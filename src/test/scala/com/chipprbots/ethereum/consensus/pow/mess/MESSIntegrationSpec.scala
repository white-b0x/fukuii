// ── L6: MESS blockchain-level reorg boundary (ECBP-1100 + Spiral deactivation + Olympia re-activation) ─────
//
// Existing MESScorerSpec covers the polynomial math and the per-call shouldRejectReorg function in isolation.
// These tests combine MESSConfig.isActiveAtBlock with ArtificialFinality.shouldRejectReorg to exercise
// the full decision at realistic ETC mainnet block numbers, including:
//   - Pre-activation gap   : before ECBP-1100 block 11,380,000 — any reorg accepted
//   - Active ECBP-1100 window : [11,380,000, 19,250,000) — polynomial applied
//   - Deactivation at Spiral  : at/after block 19,250,000 — any reorg accepted again
//   - Olympia re-activation   : at/after a hypothetical Olympia block — polynomial re-applied
//
// The guard pattern used in production is:
//   if (messConfig.isActiveAtBlock(localHeadBlock))
//     ArtificialFinality.shouldRejectReorg(timeDelta, localTD, proposedTD)
//   else false  // MESS inactive → never reject
//
// These tests lock that guard so a refactor to MESSConfig cannot silently extend/shrink the
// active window and accidentally reject valid reorgs (or accept invalid ones) outside the window.
