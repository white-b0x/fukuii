# SNAP Sync Cold Start Fix - Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-12-15  
**Issue**: SNAP sync cold sync from genesis  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**PR**: copilot/fix-snap-sync-startup-issue

## Problem Statement

When a node starts at genesis (block 0), SNAP sync was unable to properly sync because:

1. After bootstrapping to ~40k blocks, pivot was calculated as `localBest - 1024 = 39k`
2. SNAP sync would complete instantly with "zero work" (state already existed from bootstrap)
3. Node never caught up to actual chain tip (~23M blocks)

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Incorrect Pivot Selection**: Used `localBestBlock - pivotOffset` instead of `networkBestBlock - pivotOffset`
2. **High Pivot Offset**: Used 1024 blocks (vs core-geth's 64 blocks)
3. **No Genesis Support**: Couldn't start SNAP sync when chain height < pivot offset

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Network-Based Pivot Selection
```scala
// Query peers for network's highest block
val networkBestBlockOpt = getPeerWithHighestBlock.map(_.peerInfo.maxBlockNumber)

// Use network block for pivot calculation
val pivotBlockNumber = networkBestBlock - snapSyncConfig.pivotBlockOffset
```

### 2. Reduced Pivot Offset (Core-Geth Alignment)
- Changed from 1024 blocks → **64 blocks** (matches core-geth's `fsMinFullBlocks`)
- Allows SNAP sync to start much sooner
- Reduces catch-up time after SNAP sync completes

### 3. Genesis Start Support
When the network height is confirmed to be at or below the pivot offset (64 blocks), SNAP sync uses genesis (block 0) as the pivot and syncs from the genesis state root — effectively a full sync for the early chain (`SNAPSyncController.startSnapSync`):

```scala
// If chain height <= pivot offset (64), consider using genesis as pivot
if (baseBlockForPivot <= snapSyncConfig.pivotBlockOffset) {
  // Guarded: only commit to genesis when peers genuinely confirm low network height
}
```

**Important guards** (added after the original fix) prevent committing to a genesis pivot when heights are merely uninitialized:
- **No peers connected** (local pivot source): the network height is unknown — the controller schedules a retry instead of assuming the network is at genesis.
- **Peers connected but all report height 0**: heights have not been populated by the ETH status exchange yet — treated as "heights unknown" and retried rather than committing to genesis.
- Only when connected peers genuinely confirm a low network height does the node set pivot = block 0 and start account-range sync from the genesis state root; if the genesis header is unavailable it falls back to fast sync.

### 4. Extended Bootstrap
- If pivot header not available locally, continue syncing to reach it
- Automatically transitions to SNAP sync once pivot is reached
- No user intervention required

### 5. Type-Safe Refactoring
- Replaced string literals with sealed trait: `NetworkPivot`, `LocalPivot`
- Eliminates potential for typos
- Compile-time exhaustiveness checking

## Flow Comparison

### Before Fix
```
Genesis (0) 
  → Bootstrap to 1025 blocks
  → Calculate pivot: 1025 - 1024 = 1
  → SNAP sync downloads state for block 1
  → Complete in seconds (zero work, state already exists)
  → Never catches up to chain tip (23M blocks)
```

### After Fix  
```
Genesis (0)
  → Query network: discovers tip at 23M blocks
  → Calculate pivot: 23M - 64 = ~23M
  → Continue syncing headers/blocks to ~23M
  → SNAP sync downloads state for block ~23M
  → Real state download from network
  → Node catches up to chain tip
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Start fresh node from genesis with SNAP sync enabled
2. Monitor logs for:
   - Network best block discovery
   - Pivot calculation showing network-based selection
   - Extended bootstrap to reach pivot
   - SNAP sync starting at proper high pivot

### Expected Log Sequence
```
🚀 SNAP Sync Initialization
Current blockchain state: 0 blocks
[If network ≤ 64 blocks]
🚀 SNAP Sync Starting from Genesis
Using genesis (block 0) as pivot

[If network > 64 blocks]
🔄 SNAP Sync Pivot Header Not Available
Selected pivot: 23455936 (based on network best block)
Local best block: 1025
Gap: 23454911 blocks
Continuing regular sync to block 23455936

[After reaching pivot]
🎯 SNAP Sync Ready
Local best block: 23455936
Network best block: 23456000
Selected pivot block: 23455936 (source: network)
Beginning fast state sync with 16 concurrent workers
```

### Validation Criteria
- ✅ Pivot selected from network tip, not local blocks
- ✅ Extended bootstrap reaches pivot point
- ✅ SNAP sync downloads fresh state (not zero work)
- ✅ Node catches up to chain tip

## Performance Impact

### Positive Changes
1. **Faster sync start**: 64-block offset vs 1024-block offset
2. **Proper state download**: Downloads actual chain state, not already-synced blocks
3. **Network awareness**: Adapts to actual chain tip

### No Negative Impact
- Same SNAP sync protocol after pivot is reached
- Same download speeds and throughput
- Same peer requirements

## Core-Geth Alignment

| Aspect | Core-Geth | Fukuii (Before) | Fukuii (After) |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Pivot Offset | 64 blocks | 1024 blocks | **64 blocks** ✅ |
| Pivot Source | Network tip | Local best | **Network tip** ✅ |
| Genesis Start | Supported | Not supported | **Supported** ✅ |
| Extended Bootstrap | Yes | No | **Yes** ✅ |

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations
1. **Synchronized Concurrency**: Still uses `synchronized` blocks instead of actor-based concurrency
2. **No Direct Pivot Request**: Doesn't request pivot header from peer during handshake (core-geth does)
3. **Sequential Bootstrap**: Doesn't download headers + bodies + state concurrently (core-geth does)

### Future Enhancements
1. **Actor-Based Concurrency**: 
   - Design complete (see `SNAP_SYNC_ACTOR_CONCURRENCY.md`)
   - Implementation planned for future PR
   - Benefits: Non-blocking, supervised, scalable

2. **Concurrent Fetchers**:
   - Download headers, bodies, and state in parallel
   - Like core-geth's `spawnSync` with multiple goroutines

3. **Direct Pivot Request**:
   - Request pivot header from peer during initial handshake
   - Reduces latency to start SNAP sync

## Conclusion

The SNAP sync cold start issue is **RESOLVED**. The node can now:
- ✅ Start from genesis (block 0)
- ✅ Discover network's actual tip
- ✅ Calculate correct pivot from network state
- ✅ Bootstrap to reach pivot
- ✅ Perform real SNAP sync with proper state download
- ✅ Catch up to chain tip

The fix aligns with core-geth's approach while maintaining Fukuii's existing architecture. Future work on actor-based concurrency will further improve performance and code maintainability.
