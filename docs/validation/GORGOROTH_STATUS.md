## 3-Node Validation Scenario

**Purpose**: Validate Fukuii self-consistency and core functionality by testing Fukuii nodes against themselves.

### Configuration
- **3 Fukuii nodes** in Docker environment

- [x] Static node configuration
- [x] Protocol version compatibility
- [ ] Multi-client peer discovery (Fukuii ↔ Core-Geth)
- [ ] Multi-client peer discovery (Fukuii ↔ Besu)

#### Block Production & Propagation
- [x] Mining enabled on node1 only
- [x] Blocks produced consistently
- [x] Block propagation across nodes
- [x] PoW consensus maintained
- [ ] Multi-client block acceptance (Core-Geth blocks → Fukuii)
