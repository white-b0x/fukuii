/** Support trait for JsonRpcController tests that use JsonRpcControllerFixture.
  *
  * In Scala 3, MockFactory requires TestSuite self-type, which anonymous classes created by 'new
  * JsonRpcControllerFixture' don't satisfy. This trait provides the test spec itself as an implicit MockFactory so that
  * JsonRpcControllerFixture can delegate mock creation to the test spec.
  *
  * Usage: Mix this trait into test specs that use JsonRpcControllerFixture.
