   * to translate the values to BlockImportResult.
   * In particular:
   *  - `blockToEnqueue` fields won't be needed if the block are already stored in memory
   *  - The distinction between ExtendedCurrentBestBranch and SelectedNewBestBranch won't really be useful
   *  because there will be no need to put back the old branch into the block queue in case of reorganisation
   *  - `ConsensusErrorDueToMissingNode` and  `ConsensusError` would mean that the application is in an
   *  inconsistent state. Unless there is a reason to think that fukuii would self heal when that happens, I
   *  don't think there is a reason to add them here.
