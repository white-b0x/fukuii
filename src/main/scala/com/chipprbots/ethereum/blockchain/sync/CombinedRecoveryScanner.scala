/** The cohesive recovery-scan unit: integrates the three building blocks into one driver.
  *
  *   - [[com.chipprbots.ethereum.mpt.ShardEnumerator]] (#1) partitions the state trie at `scanRoot` into disjoint,
  *     exhaustive shards.
  *   - [[CombinedRecoveryScan]] (#2) walks one shard in a single pass, checking BOTH bytecode and storage per account.
  *   - [[com.chipprbots.ethereum.db.storage.RecoveryProgress]] (#3) persists completed-shard + accumulated-gap state so
  *     a crash/OOM resumes from the last completed shard instead of re-walking the whole ~86M-account trie.
  *
  * Each not-yet-completed shard is walked (optionally on a bounded thread pool — the `~2–2.6×` speedup); as each shard
  * finishes, its gaps are merged with cross-shard dedup and the progress is persisted atomically (completion index +
  * gaps in one write). The driver honours the contract the resumability audit pinned:
  *   1. it scans `progress.remainingShards` only — never re-walks a completed shard (no double-count); 2. it dedups
  *      storage roots (and code hashes) ACROSS shards via driver-level seen-sets — the same root referenced by accounts
  *      in different shards is reported once; 3. it persists one shard's completion + gaps in a single atomic
  *      `putRecoveryProgress` commit; 4. on a complete-progress checkpoint (e.g. a crash during the later download
  *      phase) it skips the scan entirely and returns the persisted gaps.
  *
  * Read-only: it touches trie/EVM state only via `.get`, and writes only `AppStateStorage` progress. Concurrent shard
  * walks are safe because each shard gets its own `getBackingStorage` handle and the underlying node/EVM/Guava-cache
  * reads are thread-safe. Marking recovery done + clearing the checkpoint (via `appStateStorage.recoveryDone()`) is the
  * caller's job, AFTER the returned gaps have been downloaded.
  *
  * @param storageForShard
  *   yields a FRESH [[MptStorage]] handle per call (e.g. `() => stateStorage.getBackingStorage(pivotBlockNumber)`); one
  *   per shard so concurrent walks don't share a handle.
  * @param concurrency
  *   max shards walked at once (`<= 1` ⇒ sequential, deterministic). Default 1 — the parallel path is opt-in.
  * @param shardDepth
  *   branch levels to descend when partitioning (1 ⇒ up to 16 shards). Forms the resume tag via the resulting count.
