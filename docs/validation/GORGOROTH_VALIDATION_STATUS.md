# Gorgoroth Network - Validation Status

**Last Updated**: December 21, 2025  
**Status**: ⚠️ **CORE FUNCTIONALITY VALIDATED - CRITICAL FIX PENDING DEPLOYMENT**

## Executive Summary

The Gorgoroth test network infrastructure has been successfully established and initial core functionality has been validated. A critical block header encoding issue related to legacy checkpointing configuration was discovered during Phase 2 validation on December 11, 2025, which prevented node synchronization. This issue has been identified, fixed in code, and all legacy checkpointing configuration has been removed. The fix is pending deployment and re-validation.

**Current Focus**: Deploy fixes and complete Phase 2 mining validation.

**Session Updates (Dec 2025)**
- Gorgoroth now keeps its *custom network name* (`network = "gorgoroth"`) while aligning chain parameters/genesis with **Mordor** to avoid private-genesis edge cases.
- The harness runs as a *private, no-discovery* environment: discovery disabled and bootnodes cleared; peering is managed via static nodes (`fukuii-cli sync-static-nodes`).
- The default topology uses a **single miner** (node1 mines; other nodes follow) for deterministic mining/sync validation.
- JSON-RPC HTTP is enabled and bound for Docker use (`0.0.0.0`), with `cors-allowed-origins = "*"`.

**Bonus**: For advanced real-world sync testing, see [Cirith Ungol Testing Guide](../testing/CIRITH_UNGOL_TESTING_GUIDE.md).

## Validation Requirements

The following areas need to be validated for Fukuii compatibility with core-geth and besu:

1. ✅ Network Communication
2. ⚠️ Mining
3. ⚠️ Fast Sync (infrastructure ready, needs extended testing)
4. ⚠️ Snap Sync (infrastructure ready, needs extended testing)
5. ⚠️ Faucet Service (infrastructure ready, needs validation)

## Current Status

### 1. Network Communicaion - ✅ VALIDATED

**Status**: Fully validated and documented

**Evidence**: See `ops/gorgoroth/VERIFICATION_COMPLETE.md` (internal validation report)

**What was tested**:
- ✅ RLPx handshakes and protocol negotiation
- ✅ Protocol compatibility (ETH68, SNAP1)
- ⚠️ Block propagation across Fukuii nodes
- ✅ Network connectivity in Docker environment
- ✅ Static node configuration

**Results**:
- All nodes successfully connect to peers
- Protocol versions compatible
- Block propagation works correctly
- No handshake failures

**Multi-client status**:
- ✅ Fukuii ↔ Fukuii: Validated (3-node and 6-node configs)
- ⚠️ Fukuii ↔ Core-Geth: Infrastructure ready (docker-compose-fukuii-geth.yml)
- ⚠️ Fukuii ↔ Besu: Infrastructure ready (docker-compose-fukuii-besu.yml)

**Next steps for complete validation**:
1. Run `fukuii-geth` configuration
2. Run `fukuii-besu` configuration
3. Execute automated test suite
4. Document results

### 2. Mining - ⚠️ FIX IMPLEMENTED, DEPLOYMENT PENDING

**Status**: Critical issue identified and fixed, awaiting deployment validation

**Latest Update (2025-12-11)**: 
A critical block header encoding issue was discovered during Phase 2 validation that prevented follower nodes from synchronizing with the mining node. The issue has been resolved through code fixes and configuration changes.

**Issue Discovered**:
- **Symptom**: Follower nodes (node2/node3) rejected headers from miner (node1) as "unrequested" with error "Given headers should form a sequence without gaps"
- **Root Cause**: Legacy checkpointing header encoding normalization was removing the extra RLP field in decoded headers, causing hash recomputation mismatches
- **Impact**: Nodes could not synchronize, preventing Phase 2 validation completion

**Fix Implemented**:
- Updated `BlockHeader.scala` to preserve `HefPostEcip1097` structure even with empty checkpoints
- Extended property tests to cover edge cases with `HefPostEcip1097(None)`
- Added regression test in `BlockHeaderSpec` for empty checkpoint headers
- Removed all legacy checkpointing configuration from Gorgoroth test config

**Rationale for Checkpointing Removal**:
- Checkpointing was withdrawn and will never be implemented in production ETC
- Removing aligns test networks with production configuration
- Prevents false positives from testing features that won't be deployed
- Maintains test clarity and relevance

**What was tested**:
- ⚠️ Mining enabled on node1 only
- ⚠️ PoW consensus mechanism  
- ⚠️ Block production on node1 (successful to block 0xe7)
- ⚠️ Header propagation to follower nodes (blocked by encoding issue)
- ⚠️ Node synchronization (blocked by encoding issue)

**Results**:
- Node1 successfully mined blocks up to 0xe7 with `eth_mining=true`
- Follower nodes reported `eth_syncing` but could not accept headers
- Issue root cause identified: RLP field normalization breaking hash chain
- Code fix implemented and validated with unit tests
- Legacy checkpointing configuration removed

**Multi-client status**:
- ⚠️ Fukuii mining: Fix implemented, deployment pending
- ⚠️ Mixed client mining: Infrastructure ready, blocked by Fukuii fix deployment
- ⚠️ Cross-client block acceptance: Infrastructure ready, blocked by Fukuii fix deployment

**Next steps for complete validation**:
1. Build new Fukuii Docker image with header encoding fixes
2. Deploy updated image to 3-node Gorgoroth network
3. Re-run Phase 2 validation: verify node1 mines and followers sync
4. Execute `test-mining.sh` to confirm end-to-end mining workflow
5. Validate `BlockFetcher` no longer emits "sequence gaps" warnings
6. Once Fukuii-to-Fukuii validated, proceed with mixed client testing
7. Start mixed client network (fukuii-geth or fukuii-besu)
8. Verify blocks mined by Core-Geth are accepted by Fukuii
9. Verify blocks mined by Fukuii are accepted by Core-Geth/Besu
10. Run mining compatibility tests
11. Document block distribution and consensus

### 3. Fast Sync - ⚠️ INFRASTRUCTURE READY

**Status**: Testing infrastructure created, extended validation needed

**Current configuration**:
- Fast sync is **disabled** in base configuration (`do-fast-sync = false`)
- This is intentional for the test network
- Infrastructure exists to enable and test fast sync

**Testing infrastructure**:
- ✅ Test procedures documented in [GORGOROTH_COMPATIBILITY_TESTING.md](../testing/GORGOROTH_COMPATIBILITY_TESTING.md)

**What needs to be tested**:
1. Fast sync from Fukuii node to new Fukuii node
2. Fast sync from Core-Geth to Fukuii
3. Fast sync from Besu to Fukuii
4. Fast sync from Fukuii to Core-Geth (if supported)
5. Fast sync from Fukuii to Besu (if supported)
6. State verification after sync
7. Performance metrics

**Blocking factors**:
- Requires network with sufficient block history (500+ blocks recommended)
- Requires time to generate blocks
- May require separate test configuration with fast sync enabled

**Recommended test procedure**:
1. Start network and let it mine 1000+ blocks
2. Add new node with fast sync enabled
3. Monitor sync progress
4. Verify final state matches
5. Repeat for different client combinations

### 4. Snap Sync - ⚠️ INFRASTRUCTURE READY

**Current configuration**:
- Snap sync is **disabled** in base configuration (`do-snap-sync = false`)
- This is intentional for the test network
- Protocol support confirmed (SNAP1)

**Testing infrastructure**:
- ✅ Test procedures documented in [GORGOROTH_COMPATIBILITY_TESTING.md](../testing/GORGOROTH_COMPATIBILITY_TESTING.md)
- ✅ Configuration examples provided
- ✅ Capability check tests defined

**What needs to be tested**:

3. Snap sync from Core-Geth to Fukuii (if supported)
4. Snap sync from Besu to Fukuii (if supported)
5. State reconstruction verification
6. Performance comparison with fast sync

**Blocking factors**:
- Requires network with significant state (1000+ blocks recommended)
- Not all clients may support snap sync on ETC
- May require specific protocol negotiation

**Recommended test procedure**:
1. Check snap sync capability on all clients
2. If supported, start network and generate substantial state

## Recent Findings & Known Issues

### Critical Issues (2025-12-11)

#### Header Encoding Issue (Legacy Checkpointing) - ✅ FIXED, PENDING DEPLOYMENT

**Discovered**: 2025-12-11 during Phase 2 validation  
**Status**: Code fix implemented, awaiting deployment and re-validation  
**Severity**: Critical - blocked node synchronization

**Description**:
When the legacy checkpointing feature was enabled (even with empty checkpoints), the block header codec was normalizing the extra RLP field back to empty during decode. This caused the locally recomputed block hash to differ from the original, breaking the parent-child hash chain and causing follower nodes to reject headers as "unrequested."

**Impact**:
- Follower nodes could not synchronize with mining nodes
- Headers were rejected with "Given headers should form a sequence without gaps"
- Mining node was blacklisted by followers for "UnrequestedHeaders"
- Phase 2 validation blocked

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified `BlockHeader.scala` to preserve header extra fields structure in decoded headers
- Extended property tests to cover empty checkpoint header edge case
- Added regression test for empty checkpoint header encoding/decoding
- Unit tests validate hash stability across encode/decode cycles

**Configuration Change**:
- Legacy checkpointing configuration fully removed from Gorgoroth test config
- Aligns with production ETC where checkpointing was withdrawn
- Prevents testing of features that won't be deployed

**Validation Required**:
1. Build Docker image with fixes
2. Deploy to 3-node network
3. Verify follower nodes sync successfully
4. Confirm no "unrequested headers" warnings
5. Execute full Phase 2 test suite

### Open Issues

**None currently blocking validation** (pending deployment of header encoding fix)

## Known Limitations

1. **Gorgoroth is a test network**: Results may differ on public networks
2. **Limited peer count**: Test network has small number of nodes
3. **Controlled environment**: Docker networking may behave differently than real internet
4. **Genesis configuration**: Custom genesis may not match mainnet exactly
5. **Checkpointing Removed**: Legacy checkpointing has been fully removed (matches production ETC)

## Success Criteria

The validation will be considered complete when:

- ✅ All network communication tests pass for all client combinations
- ⚠️ All mining compatibility tests pass for all client combinations (blocked by header encoding fix deployment)
- ⚠️ Block propagation works correctly between all Fukuii nodes (fix implemented, pending deployment)
- ⚠️ Fast sync works bidirectionally between all supported clients
- ⚠️ Snap sync works (if supported by clients) for all combinations
- ⚠️ Long-running tests (24+ hours) show no consensus issues
- ✅ Results are documented and reviewed
- ⚠️ Community testers have validated the findings

**Current Progress**: ~35% complete. Phase 2 mining and synchronization validation blocked pending deployment of header encoding fix.
