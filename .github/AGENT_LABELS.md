# Agent Labels

> **Scope note:** This document describes GitHub issue/PR *labels* only — a separate,
> narrower taxonomy from the live Claude Code subagent roster in `.claude/agents/` (12
> agents as of 2026-07; see `CLAUDE.md`'s Specialist subagents table). Only `agent: forge`
> is currently auto-applied (via `.github/labeler.yml`); the rest are manual, legacy
> labels reflecting an earlier 7-agent roster (wraith, mithril, ICE, eye, forge, herald,
> Morgoth). Do not treat this file as a mirror of `.claude/agents/`.

This document describes the automated agent labels used in the fukuii project. When agents work on PRs or issues, they automatically receive labels with fun emojis that represent their domain expertise.

## How Agent Labels Work

### Automatic vs Manual Labeling

Agent labels serve two purposes:
1. **Automatic labeling** for specific critical domains
2. **Manual labeling** to assign agents to issues or PRs

#### Automatically Applied Labels

Only **`agent: forge 🔨`** is automatically applied when PRs modify consensus-critical code:
- VM execution code (`src/main/scala/**/vm/**/*`)
- Consensus logic (`src/main/scala/**/consensus/**/*`)
- Mining code (`src/main/scala/**/mining/**/*`)
- Cryptographic operations (`crypto/**/*`)

This automatic labeling ensures that changes to the most critical parts of the codebase receive specialized review from the forge agent's domain expertise.

#### Manually Applied Labels

The other agent labels are typically applied manually:
- **`agent: wraith 👻`** - Manually add when fixing compilation errors or Scala 3 migration issues
- **`agent: mithril ✨`** - Manually add when refactoring code to use modern Scala 3 features
- **`agent: ICE 🧊`** - Manually add for large-scale migration planning and documentation tasks
- **`agent: eye 👁️`** - Manually add when the focus is on testing, validation, or quality assurance
- **`agent: herald 🧭`** - Manually add when fixing network protocol or peer communication issues
- **`agent: Morgoth 🎯`** - Manually add when coordinating complex multi-phase work or enforcing quality discipline

### When to Apply Agent Labels Manually

Maintainers and contributors should manually add agent labels to:
- **Issues**: To indicate which specialized agent should handle the issue
- **PRs**: To request review from a specific agent domain expert
- **Planning**: To organize work by agent specialization

For example:
- An issue about fixing 50 compilation errors → Add `agent: wraith 👻`
- An issue about improving test coverage → Add `agent: eye 👁️`
- A PR that modernizes implicit syntax → Add `agent: mithril ✨`
- An issue about network peer disconnections → Add `agent: herald 🧭`
- A complex multi-phase migration task → Add `agent: Morgoth 🎯`

## Agent Label Guidelines

### For Contributors

When you see agent labels on a PR:
- The label indicates the domain of expertise required for review
- Multiple agent labels mean the change affects multiple critical areas
- Pay special attention to PRs with `agent: forge 🔨` as these affect consensus-critical code

### For Reviewers

When reviewing PRs with agent labels:
- **agent: wraith 👻**: Verify compilation succeeds and Scala 3 compatibility
- **agent: mithril ✨**: Check that refactoring maintains functionality and improves code quality
- **agent: ICE 🧊**: Ensure migration strategy is sound and documentation is complete
- **agent: eye 👁️**: Verify all tests pass and new tests are added for new functionality
- **agent: forge 🔨**: Extra scrutiny required - verify deterministic behavior and consensus compatibility
- **agent: herald 🧭**: Verify network protocol changes match reference implementations (core-geth)
- **agent: Morgoth 🎯**: Verify methodology was followed, verification steps completed, and handoff is clear

### Priority and Risk

Agent labels also indicate risk level:

**Highest Risk:**
- 🔨 **forge**: Consensus-critical code requires extensive validation

**High Risk:**
- 👁️ **eye**: Testing changes affect quality assurance
- 👻 **wraith**: Compilation fixes must not introduce regressions
- 🧭 **herald**: Network protocol changes can break peer connectivity

**Medium Risk:**
- 🧊 **ICE**: Large-scale migrations need careful planning
- ✨ **mithril**: Refactoring must preserve functionality
- 🎯 **Morgoth**: Process and quality enforcement, coordinates other agents

## Creating Labels in GitHub

Before the agent labels can be used, they must first be created in the GitHub repository. See [CREATE_LABELS.md](CREATE_LABELS.md) for detailed instructions on:
- Creating labels via GitHub UI
- Creating labels via GitHub CLI
- Creating labels via API
- Recommended colors for each label

## Label Configuration

The agent label patterns are defined in `.github/labeler.yml`. If you need to update the patterns or add new agents, edit that file and update this documentation accordingly.

- [Claude Subagents](../.claude/agents/): Specialist subagent definitions — `forge`, `eye`, `wraith`, `herald`, `mithril`. The Morgoth (process discipline) and ICE (migration methodology) roles now live in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md), since Claude subagents are orchestrated by the main session rather than by another agent.
