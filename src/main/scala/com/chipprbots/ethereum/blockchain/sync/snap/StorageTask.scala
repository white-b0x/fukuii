/** Storage range task for SNAP sync
  *
  * Represents a range of storage slots to download for a specific account. Follows core-geth patterns from
  * eth/protocols/snap/sync.go (storageTask). Serves double duty as the subtask unit for large-storage contracts: when a
  * contract has too many slots to fit in one SNAP response, StorageRangeCoordinator creates N StorageTask objects
  * covering disjoint slot ranges and dispatches them in parallel (spec 005). See `StorageTask.createSubTasks()`.
  *
  * Unlike AccountTask which covers the full account space, StorageTask is per-account and tracks the storage trie for a
  * single contract account.
  *
  * @param accountHash
  *   Hash of the account whose storage is being synced
  * @param storageRoot
  *   Storage root hash for this account (for verification)
  * @param next
  *   Next storage slot hash to sync in this interval
  * @param last
  *   Last storage slot hash to sync in this interval (exclusive upper bound)
