/** Verifies BlockBody wire encoding follows EIP-2718 framing for typed transactions.
  *
  * Regression: typed-tx items previously serialized as raw `typeByte || rlp(payload)` (a PrefixedRLPEncodable in the tx
  * list). go-ethereum and besu re-request bodies forever when they see this — the items don't decode as a list of byte
  * strings. The correct framing wraps the typed envelope in an RLP byte string: `RLPValue(typeByte || rlp(payload))`.
