/** ECIP-1100: MESS (Modified Exponential Subjective Scoring).
  *
  * Anti-reorg protection: large reorgs require exponentially higher TD to override the local chain. Uses a cubic
  * polynomial to compute an "antigravity" multiplier (1x-31x) based on time since common ancestor. Reorgs under ~200s
  * are unaffected; peaks at ~7 hours (31x TD required).
  *
  * Polynomial: {{{ def get_curve_function_numerator(x): xcap = 25132 ampl = 15 height = 128 * (ampl * 2) if x > xcap: x
  * \= xcap return 128 + (3 * x**2 - 2 * x**3 // xcap) * height // xcap ** 2 }}}

  * Activation/deactivation blocks:
  *   - ETC mainnet: activated 11,380,000, deactivated 19,250,000 (Spiral)
