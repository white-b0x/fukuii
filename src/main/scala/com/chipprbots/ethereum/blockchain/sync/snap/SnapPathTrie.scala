/** Path-scheme [[StackTrie]] wrapper for SNAP sync.
  *
  * Mirrors go-ethereum `pathTrie` in `eth/protocols/snap/gentrie.go`. Three correctness invariants are enforced on top
  * of the raw [[StackTrie]]:
  *
  *   1. '''Left-boundary skip''' (`skipLeftBoundary = true`): when resuming a range that was interrupted mid-task, the
  *      first nodes emitted by [[StackTrie]] are on the left boundary — they may be incomplete because left-side
  *      siblings from before the resume cursor are absent. These nodes are silently dropped. Additionally, ancestor
  *      stubs at paths above the first emitted node are deleted from path-keyed storage — they are leftovers from the
  *      prior run that would otherwise create structural conflicts with newly-committed nodes.
  *
  * 2. '''Extension-gap cleanup''': [[StackTrie]] may emit an extension node at path P that covers a span of > 1 nibble.
  * This means path slots at depth P+1 .. P+span-1 were skipped. A prior run may have stored nodes at those inner paths;
  * this wrapper deletes them to ensure the trie's path space is uniquely occupied.
  *
  * 3. '''Right-boundary discard''' ([[reset()]]): when a task is abandoned mid-range, the ancestor nodes on the path
  * from the trie root to the last disk-committed node are deleted. Those ancestors reference incomplete subtrees
  * (right-side children were never inserted) and must be rebuilt by state healing. The last-committed node itself is
  * retained — it is a complete, valid node that healing can use as a leaf anchor.
  *
  * ==Callbacks==
  *
  * Integration with [[com.chipprbots.ethereum.db.storage.PathNodeStorage]] is through two callbacks:
  *
  *   - `writePath(nibblePath, nodeHash, rlpBlob)` — stores the node at the given nibble path.
  *   - `deleteExact(nibblePath)` — deletes the single node at exactly that path (point-delete, not prefix-delete).
  *
  * Callers construct these closures from `PathNodeStorage`, routing account-trie vs storage-trie as appropriate.
  *
  * ==Thread safety==
  *
  * Not thread-safe. Caller (a SNAP coordinator actor) serialises all calls via actor-message ordering.
  *
  * @param owner
  *   empty [[ByteString]] for the account trie; 32-byte account hash for a storage trie (informational, for call-site
  *   documentation — routing is via the callbacks).
  * @param skipLeftBoundary
  *   `true` when resuming a mid-range task with a non-empty spec-004 cursor; `false` for a fresh task.
  * @param writePath
  *   `(nibblePath, nodeHash, rlpBlob) => Unit` — writes one committed trie node to path-keyed storage.
  * @param deleteExact
  *   `nibblePath => Unit` — deletes the node at exactly that path from path-keyed storage.
