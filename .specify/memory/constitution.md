SYNC IMPACT REPORT
==================
Version change: 1.1.1 → 1.1.2
Rationale: Fukuii's agent roster (.claude/agents/forge.md, beacon.md) was rescoped from
naming exactly two networks to naming two consensus families (PoW, PoS) that ETC/Mordor
and ETH/Sepolia currently instantiate — network coverage is expected to grow within each
family over time. This constitution described the same two networks as if they were the
totality of what fukuii supports; reframed for alignment. No principle added, removed, or
substantively changed — Principle I's rules are unchanged in effect, only reframed from
"the ETC domain" / "the ETH domain" to "the PoW domain (currently ETC/Mordor)" / "the PoS
domain (currently ETH/Sepolia)" (PATCH per this doc's own versioning rule: clarification
and wording only).

Changes:
  - Preamble: "two independent chain families" → "two independent consensus families,
    each currently instantiated by one network pair"
  - Principle I: "ETC consensus domain" / "ETH/Sepolia consensus domain" → "PoW consensus
    domain (currently ETC/Mordor)" / "PoS consensus domain (currently ETH/Sepolia)";
    specialist-agent rule reframed as family-appropriate (forge for PoW, beacon for PoS)
  - Development Workflow step 7: reframed to route by consensus family first, network
    second

SYNC IMPACT REPORT
==================
Version change: 1.1.0 → 1.1.1
Rationale: Six references to `.github/agents/*.md` were factually wrong — subagent
definition files live at `.claude/agents/*.md` and always have; `.github/agents/`
contains only the unrelated Spec Kit context-update command definition. Pure path
correction, no principle or governance change (PATCH per this doc's own versioning rule).

Changes:
  - Principle I: `forge`/`beacon` agent file paths corrected (2 refs)
  - Principle I: `herald` agent file path corrected (1 ref)
  - Development Workflow step 7: agent files location corrected (1 ref)
  - Governance section: agent definitions location corrected (1 ref)

SYNC IMPACT REPORT
==================
Version change: 1.0.0 → 1.1.0
Rationale: Fukuii is now a multi-network client: ETC/Mordor (PoW, chain-ID 61/63)
AND ETH/Sepolia (PoS, chain-ID 1/11155111). Principle I was ETC-only and incorrectly
prohibited all post-Merge Ethereum features. Updated to recognize both chain families
and assign the correct specialist agent per chain.

Changes:
  - Preamble: updated from "ETC full node" to "multi-network EVM client"
  - Principle I: now covers both ETC and ETH/Sepolia consensus domains; added
    OlympiaOpCodes/forBlock() vs OsakaOpCodes/forTimestamp() code path rule;
    added beacon agent for ETH consensus; added herald for P2P wire changes

# Fukuii Constitution

Fukuii is a multi-network EVM client written in Scala 3, descended from IOHK
Mantis. It supports two independent consensus families, each currently
instantiated by one network pair — coverage within each family is expected to
grow over time:

- **Proof-of-Work (PoW)** — block-number fork dispatch. Currently: **ETC/Mordor**
  — Ethereum Classic mainnet (chain-ID 61) and Mordor testnet (chain-ID 63).
  Ethash, ECIP-1017 fixed-supply emission. Fork schedule: Atlantis → Agharta →
  Phoenix → Thanos (ECIP-1099) → Magneto → Mystique → Spiral → **Olympia**
  (ECIP-1111/1112/1121/1122).
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** — timestamp fork dispatch. Currently: **ETH/Sepolia**
  — Ethereum mainnet (chain-ID 1) and Sepolia testnet (chain-ID 11155111).
  Post-Merge, Engine API-driven block production. Active fork: Osaka.

Treat "ETC/Mordor" and "ETH/Sepolia" throughout this document as the current
instances of "PoW" and "PoS," not the ceiling of what fukuii supports.

Fukuii participates in live, adversarial, value-bearing networks on both chains.
This constitution defines the non-negotiable standards every change MUST uphold
so that contributions remain safe, repeatable, and reviewable. It applies to all
contributors, human and automated.

## Core Principles

### I. Consensus Determinism Is Sacred (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Consensus-critical code on every supported network MUST be byte-for-byte
deterministic and compliant with the governing specification for that network's
consensus family (PoW or PoS).

**PoW consensus domain** (currently ETC/Mordor): EVM and opcode/gas semantics,
state and Merkle Patricia Trie roots, block and transaction hashing, RLP
serialization, signature verification, Ethash PoW and DAG generation, block
reward schedules (ECIP-1017), chain-ID handling (EIP-155), and ETC hard-fork
activation (Atlantis → Agharta → Phoenix → Thanos → Magneto → Mystique →
Spiral → Olympia). New PoW networks fall under this same domain.

**PoS consensus domain** (currently ETH/Sepolia): PoS validator correctness via
Engine API (`engine_forkchoiceUpdated`, `engine_newPayload`), EIP-4844 blob
transaction validation, execution payload semantics, timestamp-based fork
activation, and Osaka-era EIPs (withdrawals, blob gas, EIP-7939 CLZ, etc.). New
PoS networks fall under this same domain.

Rules:
- State roots, block hashes, and gas costs MUST match the governing specification
  exactly for each network. "Close enough" is a consensus bug.
- Any change touching the domains above MUST be designed and reviewed BEFORE
  implementation — never patched reactively after a failure. Use the
  family-appropriate specialist agent: `forge` (`.claude/agents/forge.md`) for
  PoW consensus (currently ETC/Mordor); `beacon` (`.claude/agents/beacon.md`)
  for PoS consensus (currently ETH/Sepolia).
- Do NOT mix PoW and PoS code paths (currently ETC and ETH, respectively). PoW
  fork dispatch uses `EtcOlympiaOpCodes` / the 2-arg `forBlock()` overload; PoS
  fork dispatch uses `EthOsakaOpCodes` / the timestamp-aware `forBlock()`
  overload (there is no separate `forTimestamp()` method — see
  `vm/EvmConfig.scala`). A change to one family MUST NOT silently affect the
  other.
- ETC is and remains Proof-of-Work. PoS validator logic MUST NOT enter the ETC
  (or any other PoW network's) code path.
- ETH/Sepolia is post-Merge PoS. PoW-specific assumptions (Ethash DAG, mining
  rewards, ECIP-1017) MUST NOT enter the ETH/Sepolia (or any other PoS
  network's) code path.
- Wire-protocol messages MUST be formatted for the negotiated peer capability
  (e.g. ETH66+ requestId framing vs. ETH62 framing); formats MUST NOT be mixed
  on a connection. Use `herald` (`.claude/agents/herald.md`) for P2P wire changes.

Rationale: A single non-deterministic line can split the chain. This principle
outranks all others; when it conflicts with convenience, convenience loses.

### II. Spec-Driven Development

Features are built through the Spec Kit flow, not ad hoc. Each non-trivial change
flows through `/speckit-specify` → `/speckit-plan` → `/speckit-tasks` →
`/speckit-implement`, with `/speckit-clarify` and `/speckit-analyze` used to
de-risk ambiguity.

Rules:
- The specification captures the *what* and *why* (user-facing behavior and
  requirements) and MUST avoid premature implementation detail.
- The plan MUST pass the Constitution Check gate (see
  `.specify/templates/plan-template.md`) before and after design; violations are
  either removed or explicitly justified in the plan's Complexity Tracking.
- Spec artifacts live under `specs/<NNN-feature-name>/` and are committed
  alongside the code they govern.

Rationale: A written, reviewed spec makes intent explicit and review repeatable,
and lets both humans and agents pick up work without re-deriving context.

### III. Test Discipline & Tiered Coverage

Behavioral changes ship with tests, and tests MUST be deterministic.

Rules:
- Use the established stack: ScalaTest, ScalaMock/Mockito, ScalaCheck for
  property tests, Pekko TestKit for actors, Cats Effect for async.
- Tests MUST NOT use `Thread.sleep`. Use TestKit (`expectMsg`,
  `expectNoMessage`, `awaitCond`) or ScalaTest `eventually(timeout(...))`.
- Respect the three test tiers: Essential (`testEssential`, < 5 min, the PR
  gate), Standard (`testStandard`, < 30 min, + coverage), and Comprehensive
  (`testComprehensive`, full ethereum/tests). Tag tests appropriately
  (`SlowTest`, `IntegrationTest`, `SyncTest`, `FlakyTest`, `DisabledTest`).
- Statement coverage MUST stay at or above the enforced 70% minimum
  (`coverageFailOnMinimum := true`); do not lower the gate to make a build pass.
- Consensus-critical changes additionally require validation against
  ethereum/tests and confirmation that state roots, gas, and hashes are
  unchanged versus the reference.

Rationale: A node that fails silently corrupts state or forks. Deterministic,
tiered tests keep the feedback loop fast locally and exhaustive in CI.

### IV. Idiomatic, Formatted Scala 3

The codebase is Scala 3.x LTS only, under the `com.chipprbots.ethereum`
package root.

Rules:
- All code MUST pass `scalafmt` (3.8.3 config: 120 columns, Scala 3 dialect) and
  `scalafix` (DisableSyntax, ExplicitResultTypes, OrganizeImports, RemoveUnused,
  NoAutoTupling, NoValInForComprehension, ProcedureSyntax). `return` and
  `finalize` are disallowed.
- Imports MUST follow the configured group order, with
  `com.chipprbots.ethereum.*` last.
- No new `io.iohk` / `mantis` package or config references — the namespace is
  `com.chipprbots.ethereum` and the config root is `fukuii`.
- Public/exported definitions carry explicit result types (enforced by
  scalafix); prefer total, side-effect-honest functions (Cats Effect `IO`).

Rationale: A single, machine-enforced style removes bikeshedding from review and
keeps diffs about behavior, not formatting.

### V. Quality Gates Are Mandatory

`main` is always releasable. Code merges only when the automated gates are green.

Rules:
- Before opening a PR, contributors MUST run `sbt pp` (compile-all → scalafmt →
  fast tests + integration tests) locally and resolve all findings.
- CI MUST pass: format check (`scalafmtCheckAll`), `compile-all`, Tier-1
  `testEssential`, Tier-2 `testStandard` with coverage, KPI baselines, and the
  ethereum/tests integration job, plus the assembly/dist build.
- PRs require at least one approving review and resolution of all review
  conversations before merge, per `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md`.
- A red build is never merged by lowering a gate, deleting a failing test, or
  using `--no-verify` to bypass checks.

Rationale: Gates that can be skipped are not standards. Enforcing them in CI is
what makes quality repeatable rather than aspirational.

### VI. Security & Operational Safety

Fukuii guards keys and a publicly reachable network surface; security is a
first-class requirement, not an afterthought.

Rules:
- Secrets, private keys, keystores, and credentials MUST NOT be committed; the
  `.gitignore` protections for keys/keystores/`.env` MUST be preserved.
- JSON-RPC endpoints MUST default to private/localhost binding and MUST NOT be
  documented or shipped as publicly exposed. Only discovery (UDP) and P2P (TCP)
  are intended to be internet-facing.
- Dependency and CVE updates MUST be applied promptly and kept Scala 3
  compatible; releases ship an SBOM and signed (Cosign/OIDC) artifacts.
- Changes affecting cryptography, key handling, or network-exposed surfaces
  require explicit security consideration in the spec/plan and review.

Rationale: A node holds value and trust; a leaked key or an exposed RPC port is
an immediate, irreversible compromise.

### VII. Transparent Versioning & Decision Records

Change history MUST be legible to operators and contributors.

Rules:
- Versioning is semantic (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, tracked in `version.sbt`): PATCH
  per merge, MINOR at milestones, MAJOR for completion/breaking releases, per
  `.github/VERSIONING.md`.
- Commits use conventional prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `security:`, `docs:`,
  `chore:`), are atomic and imperative, and reference issues (`Fixes #NNN`).
- Architecturally significant or consensus-relevant decisions are recorded as
  ADRs under `docs/adr/`; the spec/plan links the governing ADR.
- Breaking changes MUST be flagged clearly in the PR and changelog.

Rationale: Operators run this software against real value; they must be able to
trust that a version number and changelog accurately describe what changed.

## Technology & Architecture Constraints

- **Language/Runtime**: Scala 3.x LTS on JDK 25 (OpenJDK); build with sbt
  1.10.7+. No Scala 2 and no cross-build.
- **Core libraries**: Apache Pekko (actors/HTTP), Cats Effect (`IO`), Monix,
  RocksDB for storage, BouncyCastle for crypto. New dependencies MUST be Scala 3
  compatible and justified in the plan.
- **Module boundaries**: respect the layered modules — `bytes`, `crypto`, `rlp`,
  `scalanet` (vendored P2P) as foundations; `src/main` for the node
  (`blockchain/sync`, `consensus`, `db/storage`, `domain`, `jsonrpc`, `ledger`,
  `mpt`, `network`, `vm`, `nodebuilder`). Do not create cyclic or layer-violating
  dependencies.
- **Determinism budget**: consensus/state code MUST remain within ~10% of the
  established performance baseline and produce identical results to the
  reference implementation.
- Vendored/submodule code (e.g. `scalanet`, `ets/tests`) MUST retain its
  attribution and licensing.

## Development Workflow & Quality Gates

1. Branch from the appropriate base using a descriptive name
   (`feature/...`, `fix/...`); never commit directly to protected branches.
2. Drive the work through the Spec Kit flow (Principle II); keep spec artifacts
   in `specs/<NNN-feature-name>/`.
3. Implement in idiomatic Scala 3 (Principle IV), with deterministic tests
   (Principle III).
4. Run `sbt pp` locally; pre-commit hooks may be used to enforce
   format/scalafix on staged files.
5. Open a PR with a clear title (< 70 chars), a what/why description, the testing
   approach, and any breaking-change callouts; link the spec/ADR.
6. CI gates (Principle V) and at least one review MUST pass; all conversations
   resolved before merge.
7. Consensus-critical work follows the family-appropriate specialist agent before
   merge: `forge` for PoW consensus (currently ETC/Mordor), `beacon` for PoS
   consensus (currently ETH/Sepolia), `herald` for P2P wire protocol changes.
   Both consensus families require ethereum/tests validation before merge.
   Agent files are in `.claude/agents/`.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes ad hoc practice. Where a guideline elsewhere in the
repo conflicts with it, this document wins; where this document is silent,
`docs/development/contributing.md` and the agent definitions in `.claude/agents/`
provide operational detail.

- **Amendments**: Proposed via PR that edits this file, states the rationale, and
  bumps the version. Changes that alter or remove a principle require maintainer
  approval. Use `/speckit-constitution` to keep dependent templates in sync.
- **Versioning of this document**: Semantic. MAJOR for backward-incompatible
  governance changes or principle removal/redefinition; MINOR for a new principle
  or materially expanded section; PATCH for clarifications and wording.
- **Compliance**: Every PR and review MUST verify compliance with the applicable
  principles. The plan's Constitution Check gate is the primary enforcement
  point; unavoidable deviations MUST be justified in Complexity Tracking and
  approved, not hidden.
- **Runtime guidance**: Agents and contributors read `CLAUDE.md` and the current
  plan for execution context; this file defines the standards those plans must
  satisfy.
