/** Resumable progress for the post-SNAP recovery scan, persisted so a crash/OOM mid-scan resumes from the last
  * completed shard instead of re-walking the whole ~86M-account ETC state trie from account 0.
  *
  * The scan partitions the state trie into disjoint shards (see [[com.chipprbots.ethereum.mpt.ShardEnumerator]]); each
  * shard, on completion, atomically records its index into [[completedShards]] together with the gaps it found in
  * [[missingBytecodes]]/[[missingStorageTries]]. Because both go into a single value under a single key, a crash can
  * never leave a shard "marked done" with its gaps lost (or vice versa) — the persisted state is always
  * self-consistent.
  *
  * @param scanRoot
  *   the state root being scanned (the on-disk SNAP-finalized/pivot root). Forms half the resume tag: re-enumerating
  *   shards from the SAME root is deterministic, so persisted shard indices stay meaningful only while the root is
  *   unchanged. A different root (pivot refresh) ⇒ different partition ⇒ stale indices ⇒ discard and re-scan.
  * @param shardCount
  *   number of shards the trie was partitioned into. The other half of the resume tag: a partition-fanout (depth)
  *   reconfig changes this, invalidating prior indices.
  * @param completedShards
  *   indices (0 until shardCount) of shards already fully walked; their gaps are already in the lists below.
  * @param missingBytecodes
  *   accumulated missing contract-code hashes (32 bytes each).
  * @param missingStorageTries
  *   accumulated missing contract storage tries as (accountHash, storageRoot) pairs. May contain the same storageRoot
  *   for accounts in different shards; cross-shard dedup is the driver's job, not the codec's.
  *
  * Invariants a persisted progress always satisfies (enforced by [[RecoveryProgress.deserialize]] — a value violating
  * any of them is treated as corrupt and read back as None, forcing a fresh scan):
  *   - `shardCount >= 1` — a checkpoint is only written for a non-empty trie; an empty trie has nothing to scan and is
  *     marked done directly, never via a checkpoint.
  *   - every hash (`scanRoot`, each bytecode, each account/storageRoot) is exactly 32 bytes.
  *   - `completedShards ⊆ [0, shardCount)`.
