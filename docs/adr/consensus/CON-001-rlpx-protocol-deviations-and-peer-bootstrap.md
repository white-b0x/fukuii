# ADR-011: RLPx Protocol Deviations and Peer Bootstrap Challenge

> **Historical note:** ETH wire protocols 63–67 have been removed from fukuii as of the ETH69 alignment sprint (2026). This ADR documents the original decision and remains valid as historical record. Current live protocols: ETH68, ETH69, ETH70.

## Status

Accepted (Updated 2025-11-23: Fix 2 revised - see Amendments section)

## Context

During investigation of persistent `FAILED_TO_UNCOMPRESS(5)` errors and peer handshake failures, we discovered multiple protocol deviations by remote peers (primarily CoreGeth clients) and identified a fundamental bootstrap challenge for nodes starting from genesis.

### Initial Problem Statement

- Nodes experiencing decompression failures: `FAILED_TO_UNCOMPRESS(5)` errors from Snappy library
- Status message code 0x10 suspected of causing issues
- Peer handshakes completing but connections immediately terminated
- Zero maintained peer connections despite successful discovery and status exchanges

### Investigation Findings

#### 1. RLPx Protocol Deviations by Remote Peers

Through systematic debugging and packet-level analysis, we discovered FOUR distinct protocol deviations by CoreGeth clients:

**Deviation 1: Wire Protocol Message Compression**
- **Observed**: CoreGeth clients compressing Wire Protocol messages (Hello, Disconnect, Ping, Pong - codes 0x00-0x03)
- **Specification**: Per [RLPx v5 specification](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/rlpx.md#framing), wire protocol messages (0x00-0x03) MUST NEVER be compressed regardless of p2pVersion
- **Impact**: Snappy decompression failing on received wire protocol frames

**Deviation 2: Uncompressed Capability Messages**
- **Observed**: CoreGeth clients sending uncompressed RLP data for capability messages (e.g., Status 0x10) when p2pVersion >= 4
- **Specification**: For p2pVersion >= 4, all capability messages (>= 0x10) MUST be Snappy-compressed before framing
- **Impact**: Receiving raw RLP data when compressed data expected, causing decompression failures

**Deviation 3: Malformed Disconnect Messages**
- **Observed**: Disconnect messages sent as single-byte values (e.g., `0x10`) instead of RLP lists
- **Specification**: Disconnect messages should be encoded as `RLPList(reason)` per devp2p specification
- **Impact**: Decoder expecting RLPList pattern failed on single RLPValue, causing "Cannot decode Disconnect" errors

**Deviation 4: P2P Protocol Version Mismatch**
- **Observed**: When Fukuii advertised p2pVersion 4, CoreGeth clients would send and expect uncompressed messages, but Fukuii was compressing messages
- **Specification**: RLPx v5 spec suggests compression for p2pVersion >= 4, but CoreGeth implementation uses >= 5
- **Impact**: CoreGeth clients could not decode compressed messages from Fukuii, leading to immediate disconnection with reason 0x10
- **Root Cause**: CoreGeth uses `snappyProtocolVersion = 5` (defined in `p2p/peer.go`), while Fukuii was using threshold of >= 4 for compression
- **Solution**: Aligned Fukuii's p2pVersion from 4 to 5 to match CoreGeth's compression threshold

#### 2. The Peer Bootstrap Challenge

After eliminating all decoding errors, we discovered peers were still disconnecting immediately after successful status exchange. Analysis revealed:

**Root Cause**: Genesis Block Advertisement
- Fukuii starting from genesis advertises:
  - `totalDifficulty`: 17,179,869,184 (2^34, genesis difficulty)
  - `bestHash`: d4e56740... (genesis block hash)
  - `bestHash == genesisHash` (indicating zero blockchain data)

**Peer Response**: Immediate Disconnection
- CoreGeth and other clients identify Fukuii as having no useful blockchain data
- Disconnect with reason `0x10` (Other - "Some other reason specific to a subprotocol")
- This is **correct behavior** per Ethereum protocol: peers should disconnect from useless peers to conserve resources

**The Bootstrap Paradox**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Start from Genesis → No Data → Peers Disconnect       │
│         ↑                                      ↓         │
│    Can't Sync ←─────── Need 3 Peers ──────────┘         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Fast sync (snap sync) requires minimum 3 peers to select pivot block
- Regular peers disconnect from genesis-only nodes
- Cannot sync without peers, cannot get peers without synced data

### Network Testing Results

**ETC Mainnet (Ethereum Classic)**:
- Discovered 29 nodes, all CoreGeth clients
- Successfully completed status exchanges with multiple peers
- All three protocol deviations observed consistently
- All peers disconnected with reason 0x10 after detecting genesis-only status
- 0 handshaked peers maintained after 60 seconds

**ETH Mainnet (Ethereum)**:
- Discovered 6 nodes
- Connections remain in "pending" state indefinitely
- No protocol activity observed
- Different behavior suggests ETH network peers may have stricter connection policies

### Code Locations

**MessageCodec.scala** (`/workspaces/fukuii/src/main/scala/com/chipprbots/ethereum/network/rlpx/MessageCodec.scala`):
- Handles frame decoding and Snappy compression/decompression
- Key method: `readFrames()` - processes incoming frames and applies compression

**WireProtocol.scala** (`/workspaces/fukuii/src/main/scala/com/chipprbots/ethereum/network/p2p/messages/WireProtocol.scala`):
- Defines wire protocol messages and their encoding/decoding
- `DisconnectDec` - decoder for Disconnect messages

**EtcNodeStatusExchangeState.scala** (`/workspaces/fukuii/src/main/scala/com/chipprbots/ethereum/network/handshaker/EtcNodeStatusExchangeState.scala`):
- `getBestBlockHeader()` - returns genesis header when blockchain is empty
- `createStatusMsg()` - builds status message advertised to peers

**PeerActor.scala** (`/workspaces/fukuii/src/main/scala/com/chipprbots/ethereum/network/PeerActor.scala`):
- `handleDisconnectMsg()` - processes disconnect reasons and triggers blacklisting

## Decision

### Implemented: Defensive Protocol Handling

We implement defensive programming to handle protocol deviations gracefully while maintaining specification compliance:

#### Fix 1: Wire Protocol Message Compression Detection
```scala
// In MessageCodec.readFrames()
val isWireProtocolMessage = frame.`type` >= 0x00 && frame.`type` <= 0x03
val shouldDecompress = !isWireProtocolMessage && p2pVersion >= 4
```
- **Rationale**: Explicitly exclude wire protocol messages from compression regardless of p2pVersion
- **Impact**: Prevents decompression attempts on Hello, Disconnect, Ping, Pong messages

#### Fix 2: RLP Detection for Uncompressed Data
```scala
// In MessageCodec.readFrames()
val looksLikeRLP = frameData.nonEmpty && {
  val firstByte = frameData(0) & 0xFF
  firstByte >= 0xc0 || (firstByte >= 0x80 && firstByte < 0xc0)
}

if (shouldDecompress && !looksLikeRLP) {
  // Decompress
} else if (shouldDecompress && looksLikeRLP) {
  log.warn(s"Frame type 0x${frame.`type`.toHexString}: Peer sent uncompressed RLP data despite p2pVersion >= 4 (protocol deviation)")
  // Use raw data
}
```
- **Rationale**: RLP encoding has predictable first-byte patterns (0xc0-0xff for lists, 0x80-0xbf for strings)
- **Impact**: Gracefully handles peers with protocol deviations sending uncompressed data
- **Trade-off**: False positives theoretically possible but practically unlikely (compressed data rarely starts with RLP-like bytes)

#### Fix 3: Flexible Disconnect Message Decoding
```scala
// In WireProtocol.DisconnectDec
def toDisconnect: Disconnect = rawDecode(bytes) match {
  case RLPList(RLPValue(reasonBytes), _*) =>
    // Spec-compliant case
    Disconnect(reason = ByteUtils.bytesToBigInt(reasonBytes).toLong)
  case RLPValue(reasonBytes) =>
    // Protocol deviation: single value instead of list
    Disconnect(reason = ByteUtils.bytesToBigInt(reasonBytes).toLong)
  case _ => throw new RuntimeException("Cannot decode Disconnect")
}
```
- **Rationale**: Accept both spec-compliant RLPList and non-standard single RLPValue
- **Impact**: Successfully decode disconnect messages from peers with protocol deviations

#### Fix 4: P2P Protocol Version Alignment with CoreGeth
```scala
// In EtcHelloExchangeState.scala
object EtcHelloExchangeState {
  // Use p2pVersion 5 to align with CoreGeth and enable Snappy compression
  // CoreGeth (and go-ethereum) only enable Snappy when p2pVersion >= 5
  // See: https://github.com/etclabscore/core-geth/blob/master/p2p/peer.go#L54
  val P2pVersion = 5
}
```
- **Rationale**: CoreGeth uses `snappyProtocolVersion = 5` and only enables Snappy compression when `p2pVersion >= 5`. Our previous p2pVersion 4 caused a mismatch where we compressed messages but CoreGeth expected uncompressed messages.
- **Impact**: Aligning to p2pVersion 5 ensures both sides agree on when to enable Snappy compression, preventing decode failures and disconnections
- **Root Cause**: When we advertised p2pVersion 4, CoreGeth clients would NOT enable Snappy compression (since 4 < 5), but our MessageCodec was compressing messages (since we used >= 4 threshold). CoreGeth couldn't decode the compressed messages and disconnected with reason 0x10.
- **Solution**: Changed from p2pVersion 4 to 5 to match CoreGeth's snappyProtocolVersion threshold

### Documented: Bootstrap Challenge

We document the bootstrap challenge but **do not implement a workaround** at this time because:

1. **This is expected behavior**: Peers correctly disconnect from useless (genesis-only) peers
2. **Standard Ethereum behavior**: All clients face this challenge when starting from genesis
3. **Existing solutions**: 
   - Fast sync requires 3+ peers willing to provide pivot block
   - Full sync requires peers tolerant of genesis-only nodes
   - Bootstrap/sync nodes specifically designed to help new nodes
4. **Infrastructure solution**: Operators should run dedicated bootstrap nodes or use checkpoints

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Protocol Deviations Handled**: All four CoreGeth protocol deviations now handled gracefully (wire protocol compression, uncompressed capability messages, malformed disconnect messages, and p2pVersion compression threshold mismatch)
2. **Decode Errors Eliminated**: Zero "Cannot decode" or "FAILED_TO_UNCOMPRESS" errors in testing
3. **Status Exchanges Succeed**: Handshake protocol completing successfully through status exchange
4. **Defensive But Compliant**: Code handles deviations while remaining specification-compliant
5. **Well-Documented**: Bootstrap challenge clearly documented for operators
6. **Network Interoperability**: Can communicate with CoreGeth and other clients despite their protocol deviations

### Negative

1. **Bootstrap Challenge Remains**: Nodes starting from genesis still cannot maintain peers
2. **RLP Detection Heuristic**: First-byte RLP detection is a heuristic, not foolproof
3. **Protocol Tolerance**: By accepting protocol deviations, we may enable continued non-standard implementations
4. **Blacklisting Churn**: Genesis-only nodes will repeatedly connect and get blacklisted

### Neutral

1. **Requires Infrastructure**: Operators must either:
   - Import blockchain checkpoint
   - Run dedicated bootstrap nodes
   - Use fast sync with established nodes
2. **Not a Bug**: Bootstrap challenge is a feature, not a bug - prevents network spam from useless peers

## Implementation Details

### Testing Methodology

**Test Environment**: ETC Mainnet (primary), ETH Mainnet (comparison)
**Test Duration**: 60-120 second runs
**Metrics Collected**:
- Peer discovery count
- Connection attempt count
- Status exchange success count
- Disconnect reason codes
- Protocol deviation frequency

**Key Log Analysis Commands**:
```bash
# Check status exchanges
grep -E "(Sending status|Successfully received|Peer returned status)" /tmp/fukuii_test.log

# Verify no decode errors
grep -E "Cannot decode|Unknown eth|FAILED_TO_UNCOMPRESS" /tmp/fukuii_test.log

# Check disconnect reasons
grep -E "Received Disconnect|Blacklisting" /tmp/fukuii_test.log

# Monitor handshake progress
grep -E "Handshaked" /tmp/fukuii_test.log
```

### Validation Results

**Before Fixes**:
- Persistent `FAILED_TO_UNCOMPRESS(5)` errors
- "Cannot decode Disconnect" errors
- "Unknown network message type: 16" warnings
- Connection handlers terminating unexpectedly
- Dead letter messages to TCP actors

**After Fixes**:
- ✅ Zero decompression errors
- ✅ Zero decode errors
- ✅ Successful status exchanges
- ✅ Clean connection termination
- ✅ Proper disconnect reason logging
- ❌ Still 0 handshaked peers (expected due to genesis-only status)

### CoreGeth Analysis

**Observed Client**: CoreGeth/v1.12.20-stable-c2fb4412/linux-amd64/go1.21.10
**Protocol Deviations**: All three deviations consistently observed
**Capabilities Advertised**: ETH68 (but negotiates to ETH64)
**Disconnect Reason**: 0x10 (Other) after genesis-only status detected

**Hypothesis**: CoreGeth implementation may have:
1. Different wire protocol compression logic
2. Alternative p2pVersion handling for capability messages
3. Non-standard Disconnect message encoding

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Strict Spec Enforcement
**Description**: Reject all messages with protocol deviations and disconnect peers
**Rejected Because**: Would eliminate most ETC mainnet peers (CoreGeth dominance)

### Alternative 2: Fake Blockchain Status
**Description**: Advertise non-genesis block even when at genesis to avoid disconnects
**Rejected Because**: Violates protocol honesty, would cause sync failures, unethical

### Alternative 3: Checkpoint Import
**Description**: Bundle trusted checkpoint in client, import on first start
**Rejected Because**: 
- Centralization concern (who controls checkpoints?)
- Blockchain should be verifiable from genesis
- Infrastructure problem, not protocol problem

### Alternative 4: Bootstrap Node Mode
**Description**: Add special "bootstrap node" mode that accepts genesis-only peers
**Deferred Because**: Infrastructure solution better handled by dedicated bootstrap nodes

2. **Protocol Hardening**: Evaluate moving to stricter protocol enforcement once ecosystem improves
3. **Community Engagement**: Work with ETC community to improve protocol compliance across clients

## Lessons Learned

1. **Real-World Protocols Are Messy**: Specifications and implementations often diverge; defensive programming essential
2. **Heuristics Have Value**: First-byte RLP detection is simple but effective for real-world protocol variations
3. **Bootstrap Is Hard**: All blockchain clients face the genesis bootstrap challenge; no perfect solution
4. **Testing Reveals Truth**: Comprehensive logging and real-network testing revealed issues unit tests missed
5. **Protocol Deviations Are Common**: Even widely-deployed clients (CoreGeth) can deviate from specifications
6. **Infrastructure Matters**: Some problems are better solved with infrastructure than code changes

## Amendments

### Amendment 2025-11-23: Fix 2 Revision - looksLikeRLP False Positives

**Issue Discovered**: The original Fix 2 implementation had a critical flaw. The `looksLikeRLP` check was performed BEFORE attempting decompression, which caused false positives when compressed data started with bytes in the 0x80-0xff range.

**Specific Case**: Snappy-compressed `NewPooledTransactionHashes` messages starting with byte `0x94`:
- Byte `0x94` is in the RLP range (0x80-0xbf), triggering `looksLikeRLP=true`
- Decompression was skipped, raw Snappy data passed to RLP decoder
- RLP decoder interpreted `0x94` as "string of 20 bytes", causing decode error
- Error: `ETH67_DECODE_ERROR: Unexpected RLP structure. Expected [RLPValue, RLPList, RLPList] (ETH67/68) or RLPList (ETH65 legacy), got: RLPValue(20 bytes)`

**Original Trade-off Assessment**: The original ADR stated "False positives theoretically possible but practically unlikely (compressed data rarely starts with RLP-like bytes)". This assumption proved incorrect - compressed data frequently starts with bytes in the 0x80-0xff range.

**Revised Implementation**:
```scala
// NEW: Always attempt decompression first
if (shouldCompress) {
  decompressData(frameData, frame).recoverWith { case ex =>
    // Fall back to uncompressed ONLY if decompression fails AND looks like RLP
    if (looksLikeRLP(frameData)) {
      log.warn("Decompression failed but data looks like RLP - using as uncompressed (peer protocol deviation)")
      Success(frameData)
    } else {
      Failure(ex)  // Reject invalid data
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Changes**:
1. Always attempt decompression when `shouldCompress=true`
2. Only check `looksLikeRLP` as fallback after decompression fails
3. This correctly handles both:
   - Compressed data (including when it starts with 0x80-0xff bytes)
   - Uncompressed RLP from protocol-deviating peers

**Impact**:
- ✅ Fixes peer disconnections when receiving `NewPooledTransactionHashes` messages
- ✅ Correctly decompresses messages regardless of starting byte
- ✅ Maintains graceful handling of protocol deviations (uncompressed data)
- ✅ More robust and correct than original implementation

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/scala/com/chipprbots/ethereum/network/rlpx/MessageCodec.scala`
- `LOG_REVIEW_RESOLUTION.md` (detailed analysis)

**Reference**: See `LOG_REVIEW_RESOLUTION.md` for full technical analysis of the issue and fix.

### Amendment 2025-12-04: Fix 2 Second Revision - Removing looksLikeRLP Heuristic

**Issue Discovered**: The revised Fix 2 from Amendment 2025-11-23 still had a critical flaw. The `looksLikeRLP` heuristic only accepted RLP data starting with bytes >= 0x80, but valid RLP can also start with bytes 0x00-0x7f (single-byte values in RLP direct encoding).

**Specific Case**: When CoreGeth sends uncompressed RLP messages that happen to encode with a first byte < 0x80:
- Byte 0x00-0x7f is valid RLP (single-byte direct value encoding)
- Decompression fails (as expected, since data is not compressed)
- `looksLikeRLP` check returns false (because firstByte < 0x80)
- Fallback rejects the data → MalformedMessageError
- Connection closes, peer gets blacklisted

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. RLP encoding allows ANY byte 0x00-0xff as first byte:
   - 0x00-0x7f: Single byte values (direct encoding)
   - 0x80-0xbf: RLP strings
   - 0xc0-0xff: RLP lists
2. The `looksLikeRLP` heuristic was trying to distinguish compressed from uncompressed data
3. However, Snappy data can ALSO start with 0x00-0x7f (varint length encoding for small payloads)
4. This makes first-byte heuristics unreliable for distinguishing Snappy from RLP

**Revised Implementation**:
```scala
// NEW: Always fall back to uncompressed data when decompression fails
// Let the RLP decoder validate whether it's actually valid RLP
decompressData(frameData, frame).recoverWith { case ex =>
  log.warn("Decompression failed - treating as uncompressed data")
  Success(frameData)  // Always accept, let RLP decoder validate
}
```

**Key Changes**:
1. Removed `looksLikeRLP` heuristic entirely
2. Always fall back to uncompressed data when decompression fails
3. Let the RLP message decoder validate if the data is actually valid RLP
4. If it's invalid data, the RLP decoder will fail with appropriate error

**Why This Is Better**:
- ✅ Accepts ALL valid uncompressed RLP from protocol-deviating peers (including 0x00-0x7f)
- ✅ Still rejects truly invalid data (RLP decoder will fail)
- ✅ Simpler logic with fewer edge cases
- ✅ More robust than trying to guess data format from first byte
- ✅ Aligns with defense-in-depth principle: each layer validates its own concerns

**Impact**:
- ✅ Fixes peer blacklisting when CoreGeth sends uncompressed messages starting with < 0x80
- ✅ Maintains compatibility with all valid RLP encodings
- ✅ Still protects against truly malformed data (validated by RLP decoder)
- ✅ Resolves the "node is currently blacklisting all peers" issue

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/scala/com/chipprbots/ethereum/network/rlpx/MessageCodec.scala`
- `src/test/scala/com/chipprbots/ethereum/network/p2p/MessageCodecSpec.scala`

**Testing**:
- Added test case simulating CoreGeth sending uncompressed messages despite p2pVersion=5
- Verified existing tests still pass with new logic
