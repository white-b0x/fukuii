## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. Please be respectful and professional in all interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To contribute to Fukuii, you'll need:

- **JDK 25** - Required for building and running the project
- **sbt** - Scala build tool (version 1.10.7 or higher)
- **Git** - For version control
- **Optional**: Python (for auxiliary scripts)

### Scala Version Support

Fukuii is built with **Scala 3.3.7 (LTS)**, the latest long-term support version of Scala 3, providing modern language features, improved type inference, and better tooling support.

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/fukuii.git
   cd fukuii
   ```

2. **Update submodules:**
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

3. **Verify your setup:**
   ```bash
   sbt compile
   ```

### Quick Start with GitHub Codespaces

For the fastest setup, use GitHub Codespaces which provides a pre-configured development environment. See [Codespaces Setup](codespaces.md) for details.

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our [Code Quality Standards](#code-quality-standards)

3. **Test your changes** thoroughly

4. **Run pre-commit checks** (see below)

5. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive commit messages

6. **Push and create a Pull Request**

## Code Quality Standards

Fukuii uses several tools to maintain code quality and consistency:

### Code Formatting with Scalafmt

We use [Scalafmt](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/) for consistent code formatting. Configuration is in `.scalafmt.conf`.

**Format your code:**
```bash
sbt scalafmtAll
```

**Check formatting without changes:**
```bash
sbt scalafmtCheckAll
```

### Static Analysis with Scalafix

We use [Scalafix](https://scalacenter.github.io/scalafix/) for automated code refactoring and linting. Configuration is in `.scalafix.conf`.

**Apply Scalafix rules:**
```bash
sbt scalafixAll
```

**Check Scalafix rules without changes:**
```bash
sbt scalafixAll --check
```

### Static Bug Detection with Scapegoat

We use [Scapegoat](https://github.com/scapegoat-scala/scapegoat) for static code analysis to detect common bugs, anti-patterns, and code smells. Configuration is in `build.sbt`.

**Run Scapegoat analysis:**
```bash
sbt runScapegoat
```

This generates both XML and HTML reports in `target/scala-3.3/scapegoat-report/`. The HTML report is especially useful for reviewing findings in a browser.

**Note**: Scapegoat automatically excludes generated code (protobuf files, BuildInfo, etc.) from analysis.

### Code Coverage with Scoverage

We use [Scoverage](https://github.com/scoverage/sbt-scoverage) for measuring code coverage during test execution. Configuration is in `build.sbt`.

**Run tests with coverage:**
```bash
sbt testCoverage
```

This will:
1. Enable coverage instrumentation
2. Run all tests across all modules
3. Generate coverage reports in `target/scala-3.3.7/scoverage-report/`
4. Aggregate coverage across all modules

**Coverage reports locations:**
- HTML report: `target/scala-3.3.7/scoverage-report/index.html`
- XML report: `target/scala-3.3.7/scoverage-report/cobertura.xml`

**Coverage thresholds:**
- Minimum statement coverage: 70%
- Coverage check will fail if minimum is not met

**Note**: Scoverage automatically excludes:
- Generated protobuf code
- BuildInfo generated code
- All managed sources

### Combined Commands

**Format and fix all code (recommended before committing):**
```bash
sbt formatAll
```

**Check all formatting and style (runs in CI):**
```bash
sbt formatCheck
```

**Prepare for PR submission (format, style, and test):**
```bash
sbt pp
```

### Scala 3 Development

Fukuii uses **Scala 3.3.7 (LTS)** and **JDK 25 (LTS)** exclusively. The migration from Scala 2.13 and JDK 17 was completed in October 2025.

**Key Scala 3 Features in Use:**
- Native `given`/`using` syntax for implicit parameters
- Union types for flexible type modeling
- Opaque types for zero-cost abstractions
- Improved type inference
- Native derivation (no Shapeless dependency)

**Build and Test:**
```bash
sbt compile-all  # Compile all modules
sbt testAll      # Run all tests
```

**Notes:**
- The project is Scala 3 only (no cross-compilation)
- All dependencies are Scala 3 compatible
- CI pipeline tests on Scala 3.3.7 with JDK 25
- See [INF-001: Scala 3 Migration](../adr/infrastructure/INF-001-scala-3-migration.md) for the architectural decision
- See [Migration History](../historical/MIGRATION_HISTORY.md) for details on the completed migration

## Pre-commit Hooks

To ensure code quality, we strongly recommend setting up pre-commit hooks that automatically check your code before each commit.

### Option 1: Manual Git Hook (Recommended)

Create a pre-commit hook that runs formatting and style checks:

1. **Create the hook file:**
   ```bash
   cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit << 'EOF'
   #!/bin/bash
   
   echo "Running pre-commit checks..."
   
   # Run scalafmt check
   echo "Checking code formatting with scalafmt..."
   sbt scalafmtCheckAll
   if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
     echo "❌ Code formatting check failed. Run 'sbt scalafmtAll' to fix."
     exit 1
   fi
   
   # Run scalafix check
   echo "Checking code with scalafix..."
   sbt "scalafixAll --check"
   if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
     echo "❌ Scalafix check failed. Run 'sbt scalafixAll' to fix."
     exit 1
   fi
   
   echo "✅ All pre-commit checks passed!"
   EOF
   ```

2. **Make it executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
   ```

### Option 2: Auto-fix Pre-commit Hook

This variant automatically fixes formatting issues before committing:

```bash
cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

echo "Running pre-commit auto-fix..."

# Auto-format code
echo "Auto-formatting with scalafmt..."
sbt scalafmtAll

# Auto-fix with scalafix
echo "Auto-fixing with scalafix..."
sbt scalafixAll

# Add any formatted files back to the commit
git add -u

echo "✅ Pre-commit auto-fix complete!"
EOF

chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Option 3: Quick Check Hook (Faster)

For a faster pre-commit check that only validates changed files:

```bash
cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

echo "Running quick pre-commit checks..."

# Get list of staged Scala files
STAGED_SCALA_FILES=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep '\.scala$')

if [ -z "$STAGED_SCALA_FILES" ]; then
  echo "No Scala files to check."
  exit 0
fi

echo "Checking formatting of staged files..."
for file in $STAGED_SCALA_FILES; do
  if [ -f "$file" ]; then
    # Check if file is formatted (scalafmt will exit non-zero if formatting would change it)
    if ! sbt "scalafmt --test $file" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
      echo "❌ $file is not formatted. Run 'sbt scalafmtAll' to fix."
      exit 1
    fi
  fi
done

echo "✅ Quick pre-commit checks passed!"
EOF

chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Bypassing Pre-commit Hooks

If you need to bypass the pre-commit hook in an emergency (not recommended):
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Your commit message"
```

### IDE Integration

Most IDEs support automatic formatting on save:

#### IntelliJ IDEA
1. Install the Scalafmt plugin
2. Go to `Settings → Editor → Code Style → Scala`
3. Select "Scalafmt" as the formatter
4. Enable "Reformat on file save"

#### VS Code
1. Install the Metals extension
2. Enable format on save in settings:
   ```json
   {
     "editor.formatOnSave": true,
     "[scala]": {
       "editor.defaultFormatter": "scalameta.metals"
     }
   }
   ```

## Testing

Always run tests before submitting your changes:

**Run all tests:**
```bash
sbt testAll
```

**Run tests by tier (TEST-002):**
```bash
# Tier 1: Essential tests (< 5 min)
sbt testEssential

# Tier 2: Standard tests with coverage (< 30 min)
sbt testCoverage

# Tier 3: Comprehensive tests (< 3 hours)
sbt testComprehensive
```

**Run specific module tests:**
```bash
sbt bytes/test
sbt crypto/test
sbt rlp/test
sbt test
```

**Run integration tests:**
```bash
sbt "IntegrationTest / test"
```

### Async Testing Best Practices

When writing tests for actor-based code using Pekko/Akka TestKit, follow these patterns to avoid flaky tests:

**✅ DO: Use TestKit patterns for waiting**
```scala
// Wait for a message with timeout
probe.expectMsg(5.seconds, expectedMessage)

// Wait for any message of a type
probe.expectMsgClass(classOf[MyMessage])

// Wait for a condition to become true
awaitCond(someCondition, 5.seconds)

// Verify no messages are received
// Note: Use this on probes that receive messages FROM the actor under test
// to verify it doesn't send unexpected messages
probe.expectNoMessage(1.second)
```

**❌ DON'T: Use Thread.sleep**
```scala
// NEVER do this - creates flaky tests
Thread.sleep(1000)
// Check some condition
```

**Why?** `Thread.sleep` makes tests:
- **Flaky**: Timing can vary based on system load
- **Slow**: You wait the full duration even if the condition is met earlier
- **Unreliable**: No guarantee the actor has finished processing

**Use ScalaTest's `eventually` for polling conditions:**
```scala
import org.scalatest.concurrent.Eventually._
import org.scalatest.time.{Seconds, Span}

eventually(timeout(Span(5, Seconds))) {
  // Condition that should eventually become true
  stateChecker() shouldBe expectedValue
}
```

### Actor IO Error Handling with Cats Effect

When using Cats Effect `IO` with actors, follow this pattern to ensure deterministic error propagation:

**✅ DO: Use explicit error handling with `IO.attempt` and `Status.Failure`**
```scala
import org.apache.pekko.actor.Status

private def pipeToRecipient[T](recipient: ActorRef)(task: IO[T]): Unit = {
  implicit val ec = context.dispatcher
  
  // Convert IO[T] into Future[Either[Throwable, T]] for explicit error handling
  val attemptedF = task.attempt.unsafeToFuture()
  
  // Map Left(ex) -> Status.Failure(ex) so recipients get a clear Failure message
  val mappedF = attemptedF.map {
    case Right(value) => value
    case Left(ex)     => Status.Failure(ex)
  }
  
  mappedF.pipeTo(recipient)
}

// Usage: piping to external actors (e.g., sender)
case GetSomething =>
  pipeToRecipient(sender())(fetchSomething())

// Usage: piping to self (requires Status.Failure handler)
case StartAsyncOperation =>
  pipeToRecipient(self)(performOperation())

case Status.Failure(ex) =>
  log.warning("Async operation failed: {}", ex.getMessage)
  // Handle failure appropriately
```

**❌ DON'T: Use `onError` with `unsafeToFuture().pipeTo()`**
```scala
// NEVER do this - creates race conditions and flaky tests
task
  .onError(ex => IO(log.error(ex, "Error message")))
  .unsafeToFuture()
  .pipeTo(recipient)
```

**Why?** The `onError` approach causes:
- **Race conditions**: Logging and error delivery timing is non-deterministic
- **Flaky tests**: Tests that simulate errors may pass or fail unpredictably
- **Unclear contract**: The error handling isn't explicit in the code

## Submitting Changes

1. **Ensure all checks pass:**
   ```bash
   sbt pp  # Runs format, style checks, and tests
   ```

2. **Commit your changes:**
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Reference relevant issue numbers (e.g., "Fix #123: Description")
   - Keep commits focused and atomic

3. **Push your branch:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Create a Pull Request:**
   - Provide a clear description of your changes
   - Reference any related issues
   - Ensure all CI checks pass
   - Be responsive to review feedback

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Title**: Clear and descriptive (e.g., "Add support for EIP-1559" or "Fix memory leak in RPC handler")
- **Description**: Explain what changes were made and why
- **Testing**: Describe how you tested your changes
- **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation if needed
- **Breaking Changes**: Clearly mark any breaking changes

### Continuous Integration

Our CI pipeline automatically runs on Scala 3.3.7:
- ✅ Compilation (`compile-all`)
- ✅ Code formatting checks (`formatCheck` - includes scalafmt + scalafix)
- ✅ Static bug detection (`runScapegoat`)
- ✅ Test suite with code coverage (`testCoverage`)
- ✅ Coverage reports (published as artifacts)
- ✅ Build artifacts (`assembly`, `dist`)

All checks must pass before a PR can be merged.

### Releases and Supply Chain Security

Fukuii uses an automated one-click release process with full traceability.

When a release is created (via git tag `vX.Y.Z`), the release workflow automatically:
- ✅ Builds distribution package (ZIP) and assembly JAR
- ✅ Generates CHANGELOG from commits since last release
- ✅ Creates Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in CycloneDX format
- ✅ Attaches all artifacts to GitHub release
- ✅ Builds and publishes container images to `ghcr.io/chippr-robotics/fukuii`
- ✅ Signs images with [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/) (keyless, GitHub OIDC)
- ✅ Generates a build provenance attestation (not the formal SLSA Level 3 attestation — removed 2026-04-27 after persistent CI startup failures; see `release.yml`)
- ✅ Outputs immutable digest references for tamper-proof deployments
- ✅ Closes matching milestone

**Release Artifacts:**
Each release includes:
- Distribution ZIP with scripts and configs
- Standalone assembly JAR
- CHANGELOG.md with categorized changes
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
- Signed Docker images with provenance

**Making a Release:**
```bash
# Ensure version.sbt is updated
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

**Verify Release Images:**
```bash
cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity-regexp=https://github.com/chippr-robotics/fukuii \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  ghcr.io/chippr-robotics/fukuii:v1.0.0
```

**Release Drafter:**
Release notes are automatically drafted as PRs are merged. Use descriptive commit messages with prefixes:
- `feat:` for features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `security:` for security fixes
- `docs:` for documentation

See the [CI/CD Documentation](ci-cd.md) for detailed release process documentation.
