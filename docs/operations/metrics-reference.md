# Metrics Reference

This page is the operator-facing reference for every Prometheus metric Fukuii exposes,
what each one means, and where it is visualized. For the narrative monitoring guide
(alert rules, Kamon, logging) see [SNAP Sync Monitoring](monitoring-snap-sync.md).

## Endpoint and configuration

Metrics are served by an embedded Prometheus HTTP server:

```hocon
fukuii.metrics {
  # Disabled by default — enable it for any monitored deployment.
  enabled = true

  # Default port is 13798; production compose files (Barad-dûr) override this to 9095.
  port = 13798
}
```

Scrape `http://<node>:<port>/metrics` (inside the Barad-dûr containers: `:9095/metrics`).
All application metrics carry the `app_` prefix. Conventions to know when reading the tables:

- **Counters** are monotonic and exported with a `_total` suffix; rate them in PromQL.
- **Timers** (Micrometer) export three series: `<name>_seconds_count`, `<name>_seconds_sum`,
  `<name>_seconds_max`.
- **Gauges** are point-in-time values set by the emitting subsystem.
- JVM and process metrics (`jvm_*`, `process_*`) are auto-registered alongside the app metrics.

> **Multi-instance caveat (Bug 29):** all instances of a multi-chain process write into one
> shared registry, so every `/metrics` endpoint serves identical content. Run one container
> per chain for per-chain observability.

**Dashboards referenced below** ("Surfaced in" column):

- **SNAP Sync** — `ops/grafana/Sync/fukuii-snap-sync.json` (rows: Phase & Pivot, Backpressure,
  Progress, Peer Pool Health, Request Health, State Healing)
- **Node Health** — `ops/grafana/ETC Node/fukuii-node-health.json`
- A dash (—) means the metric is exported but not on either of those two dashboards.

Some registered metrics have no emitter wired yet; these are marked **Reserved** and always
read 0. They are listed so operators don't mistake a permanent 0 for a healthy signal.

> ### Reading the healing walk
>
> After a restart mid-healing, the coordinator rebuilds its frontier with a level-order BFS
> over the locally stored state trie. `healing_rebuild_visited` climbs monotonically during
> **one** walk and is reset to a fresh count whenever a new walk starts — treat it as
> per-walk progress, not a lifetime counter. The dashboard's "BFS Walk Progress" panel
> divides it by a **~119 M node estimate** for ETC mainnet state, so the percentage is a
> rough yardstick, not an exact ETA. While the walk runs, `nodes_healed` and
> `frontier_pending` pulse together: each completed BFS level delivers a batch of
> newly discovered missing nodes (backlog rises), heal requests then drain it
> (`active_requests` shows the in-flight `GetTrieNodes`), and `nodes_healed` steps up.
> If the walk is skipped entirely (`[HEAL-RESTART] Resumed ... from a complete persisted
> snapshot` in the logs), `rebuild_visited` stays flat — that is normal.

## Heal-walk performance observability (spec 002 US2)

These gauges instrument the post-SNAP `[HEAL-BFS]` frontier-rebuild walk so an operator can tell
whether a slow walk is **cache-, GC-, or disk-bound** and whether shared-subtrie re-walk is
inflating the work. They are **observation-only** — they never influence which nodes the walk
enqueues, visits, or declares missing. The coordinator pushes them at each BFS level boundary
(`TrieNodeHealingCoordinator.rebuildFrontierBFS`) and also appends the same numbers to the
`[HEAL-BFS] Level complete` log line.

> **Scope caveat — read this before charting.** The three per-phase timing gauges and the
> inflation ratio are **per-level, last-write-wins**: each level boundary overwrites the previous
> value, so at any scrape they reflect the **most recently completed level**, not a walk total.
> Watch them as a live "what is this level doing" signal, not a cumulative sum. The GC gauges are
> the exception — they are **cumulative since walk start** (the sampler holds a baseline from the
> first level and reports the delta against it), so GC pause/fraction grow over the walk while the
> per-phase/inflation gauges oscillate level to level.

| Metric | Type | Meaning | Surfaced in |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `app_snapsync_healing_phase_queue_read_ms_gauge` | gauge | Per-level time (ms) spent in BFS-queue reads (`iterateRange`/`scanRange` chunk fetch). Aggregate CPU across readers when the level runs in parallel sub-ranges. Last-write-wins per level. | SNAP Sync: State Healing (Heal Phase Timing) |
| `app_snapsync_healing_phase_trie_read_ms_gauge` | gauge | Per-level time (ms) spent in `multiGetNodes` — the dominant random trie read. A high value here vs. queue-read/queue-write means the walk is **disk/trie-read bound**; cross-check the RocksDB cache hit-rate below. | SNAP Sync: State Healing (Heal Phase Timing) |
| `app_snapsync_healing_phase_queue_write_ms_gauge` | gauge | Per-level time (ms) spent in `enqueueBatch` (BFS-queue writes). Aggregate CPU when parallel. Last-write-wins per level. | SNAP Sync: State Healing (Heal Phase Timing) |
| `app_snapsync_healing_gc_pause_ms_gauge` | gauge | **Cumulative since walk start.** GC pause time (ms) accumulated in the walk window, sampled via `GcPressureSampler` (JVM-wide GC during the window, which the walk dominates — not attributed solely to the walk). | SNAP Sync: State Healing (Heal GC Pressure) |
| `app_snapsync_healing_gc_fraction_gauge` | gauge | **Cumulative since walk start.** GC pause ms ÷ wall ms over the walk window. A fraction creeping toward, say, 0.2+ means the walk is **GC-bound** — lower the visited cap or raise heap before chasing disk. | SNAP Sync: State Healing (Heal GC Pressure) |
| `app_snapsync_healing_inflation_ratio_gauge` | gauge | Per-level re-walk inflation: `childRefsSeen ÷ max(1, distinctEnqueued)`. **1.0 = no shared-subtrie inflation**; > 1 means child references were seen more than once (the visited-set de-dup gate's workload). **SC-004 guidance: < 1.5× is healthy.** This is the number that justifies any `healing-visited-cap` change — raise the cap only when this ratio is high and you have heap headroom; never set it to a value (e.g. 20M) that risks OOM at 6g. | SNAP Sync: State Healing (Heal Inflation Ratio) |

## RocksDB block cache (spec 002 US2 — `app_db_rocksdb_*`)

These poll gauges sample the RocksDB block-cache hit/miss tickers at scrape time. They are **only
populated when `db.rocksdb.enable-statistics = true`** (statistics add ~1–2 % overhead, so the
flag is off by default); with the flag off, every series reads **0.0**. Use them to confirm a slow
heal walk (high `healing_phase_trie_read_ms`) is genuinely **cache-miss-bound** *before* raising
`db.rocksdb.max-open-files` or `db.rocksdb.block-cache-size` — both of those knobs only help if the
hit-rate is low. The block cache is **off-heap** and counts against the container memory cgroup, so
raise `block-cache-size` cautiously.

| Metric | Type | Meaning | Surfaced in |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `app_db_rocksdb_block_cache_hit` | gauge | Cumulative `BLOCK_CACHE_HIT` ticker since DB open. `0.0` when statistics disabled. | SNAP Sync: State Healing (RocksDB Cache Hit Rate) |
| `app_db_rocksdb_block_cache_miss` | gauge | Cumulative `BLOCK_CACHE_MISS` ticker since DB open. `0.0` when statistics disabled. | SNAP Sync: State Healing (RocksDB Cache Hit Rate) |
| `app_db_rocksdb_block_cache_hit_rate` | gauge | Derived `hit / (hit + miss)`; `0.0` when statistics disabled or the denominator is 0. A low value during a slow walk = the walk is **cache-miss-bound**; raising `max-open-files`/`block-cache-size` may help. | SNAP Sync: State Healing (RocksDB Cache Hit Rate) |
| `app_db_rocksdb_index_filter_hit` | gauge | Cumulative index- + filter-block cache hits (`BLOCK_CACHE_INDEX_HIT + BLOCK_CACHE_FILTER_HIT`). `0.0` when statistics disabled. | — |
| `app_db_rocksdb_index_filter_miss` | gauge | Cumulative index- + filter-block cache misses (`BLOCK_CACHE_INDEX_MISS + BLOCK_CACHE_FILTER_MISS`). A high index/filter miss rate points at too few open files / undersized cache for the SST count. | — |

| `app_snapsync_peers_capable_gauge` | gauge | Handshaked peers that negotiated the SNAP/1 capability, tracked by the SNAP sync controller. | SNAP Sync: Peer Pool Health |
| `app_snapsync_peers_blacklisted_total` | counter | Every blacklist event, regardless of reason group — incremented by the shared blacklist on each add (duplicate of the network counters, kept so the SNAP dashboard can stay within `snapsync_*`). | SNAP Sync: Peer Pool Health (Demotion + Eviction Rate) |
| `app_snapsync_peers_snapless_confirmed_total` | counter | Peers demoted as snapless by the account coordinator after 3 strikes (advertise SNAP but never serve it). | SNAP Sync: Peer Pool Health |
| `app_snapsync_peers_stateless_confirmed_total` | counter | Peers demoted as stateless by the account/storage coordinators after 3 strikes (no longer hold the pivot's state). | SNAP Sync: Peer Pool Health |

| `app_snapsync_responses_malformed_total` | counter | Reserved — undecodable SNAP responses; no emitter wired (always 0). | SNAP Sync: Request Health (Data Integrity) |
| `app_snapsync_validation_failures_total` | counter | Reserved — state-validation failures; no emitter wired (always 0). | SNAP Sync: Request Health; Node Health: Errors |
