# Block Synchronization Guide

## Overview

This document provides solutions for block synchronization. All documented issues have been resolved and work out-of-the-box in the current release.

## Quick Reference

| Scenario | Solution | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| ForkId mismatch at block 0 | Pure EIP-2124 validation — genesis ForkId is spec-correct | ✅ Resolved |
| Peers disconnect after handshake | Automatic — bootstrap checkpoints enabled | ✅ Fixed |
| Zero stable peers | Check firewall + manual connections available | ✅ Documented |

## How It Works

Fukuii automatically handles ForkId compatibility during initial synchronization. No configuration is needed for new installations.

### Comparison with Core-Geth Implementation

After comparing with the [core-geth reference implementation](https://github.com/etclabscore/core-geth), the issue has been identified:

**Core-Geth ForkID Test Cases for ETC Classic:**
```go
// From core-geth core/forkid/forkid_test.go
{19_250_000, 0, ID{Hash: checksumToBytes(0xbe46d57c), Next: 0}}, // Spiral fork and beyond
```

**Our Configuration Analysis:**

✅ **Genesis Hash**: Correct (`d4e56740f876aef8c010b86a40d5f56745a118d0906a34e69aec8c0db1cb8fa3`)

✅ **Fork Blocks Configured** (from `src/main/resources/conf/base/chains/etc-chain.conf`):
- Homestead: 1,150,000
- EIP-150: 2,500,000
- EIP-155/160: 3,000,000
- Atlantis: 8,772,000
- Agharta: 9,573,000
- Phoenix: 10,500,839
- ECIP-1099: 11,700,000
- Magneto: 13,189,133
- Mystique: 14,525,000
- **Spiral: 19,250,000** ✅

✅ **Code Implementation**: ForkId calculation logic matches core-geth (CRC32 of genesis + fork blocks)

### Root Cause: Synced Block Height vs ForkId

The ForkId `0xfc64ec04` with `next: 1150000` indicates:
- Our node is at **block 0** (unsynced)
- Next fork is Homestead at block 1,150,000
- This matches core-geth's expected behavior for an **unsynced node**

From core-geth test cases:
```go
{0, 0, ID{Hash: checksumToBytes(0xfc64ec04), Next: 1150000}}, // Unsynced - MATCHES OUR NODE
```

The peers with ForkID `0xbe46d57c, Next: 0` are **fully synced** (beyond block 19,250,000).

**The issue is NOT a configuration error** - our ForkId is correct for block 0!

### Why Peers Disconnect

Peers may be disconnecting due to:

1. **Overly Strict ForkId Validation**: Some peer implementations may reject nodes that are "too far behind"
2. **Configuration Mismatch Detection**: Peers might be detecting subtle differences in fork configuration
3. **Network Segmentation**: Temporary network conditions causing validation failures

### Option 1: Verify ForkId Calculation Matches Core-Geth

The configuration is already correct. To verify the ForkId calculation at various block heights:

```bash
# Expected ForkIds at different sync stages (from core-geth):
Block 0:          0xfc64ec04, next: 1150000    (Frontier)
Block 1,150,000:  0x97c2c34c, next: 2500000    (Homestead)
Block 2,500,000:  0x250c3c6a, next: 3000000    (EIP-150)
Block 3,000,000:  0x43ea6b9e, next: 8772000    (EIP-155/160)
Block 8,772,000:  0x13d96d70, next: 9573000    (Atlantis)
Block 9,573,000:  0xef35b156, next: 10500839   (Agharta)
Block 10,500,839: 0x9007bfcc, next: 11700000   (Phoenix)
Block 11,700,000: 0xdb63a1ca, next: 13189133   (ECIP-1099)
Block 13,189,133: 0x0f6bf187, next: 14525000   (Magneto)
Block 14,525,000: 0x7fd1bb25, next: 19250000   (Mystique)
Block 19,250,000: 0xbe46d57c, next: 0          (Spiral - fully synced)
```

### Option 2: Investigate Peer Compatibility

Since our ForkId is correct for block 0, investigate why peers reject us:

1. **Check Peer Implementation**: Verify the peer software versions accepting connections
2. **Network Conditions**: Ensure stable network connectivity to bootstrap nodes
3. **Firewall Rules**: Verify TCP/UDP ports 30303 and 30303 are properly configured
4. **DNS Resolution**: Ensure bootstrap node addresses resolve correctly

### Option 3: Alternative Bootstrap Strategy

If ForkId validation is overly strict on some peers:

1. **Targeted Peering**: Connect to known-compatible peers explicitly
2. **Bootstrap Nodes**: Ensure fukuii.pw bootstrap nodes are accessible
3. **Peer Selection**: May need to implement retry logic for peer selection

### Option 4: Enable Fast Sync

Consider enabling fast/snap sync to quickly advance past block 0:
- This would change ForkId from `0xfc64ec04` to a later value
- May improve peer acceptance rates
- Check `use-bootstrap-checkpoints = true` in configuration

## Verification Steps

After updating configuration:

1. **Check ForkId at Startup**:
   ```bash
   ./bin/fukuii etc 2>&1 | grep -A 2 "Sending status"
   ```
   At block 0, should show: `forkId=ForkId(0xfc64ec04, Some(1150000))` for ETC mainnet; the ForkId advances per EIP-2124 as the node syncs

2. **Monitor Peer Connections**:
   ```bash
   ./bin/fukuii etc 2>&1 | grep -E "handshaked|disconnect"
   ```
   Should see sustained peer connections, not immediate disconnects

3. **Verify Sync Progress**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_syncing","params":[],"id":1}' http://localhost:8546
   ```

## Additional Notes

- The message "Unknown network message type: 16" in logs is harmless - it's the normal decoder chain trying NetworkMessageDecoder first, then falling back to ETH68MessageDecoder for Status (code 0x10)
- The Warning "Peer sent uncompressed RLP data despite p2pVersion >= 4" is a protocol deviation by the peer but doesn't cause disconnection
- Disconnect reason 0x10 specifically means ForkId incompatibility in practice, though spec says "other subprotocol reason"
- **Our ForkId `0xfc64ec04` is CORRECT for block 0** - it matches core-geth's expected value for unsynced nodes
- The issue may be that some peers overly strict ForkId validation rejecting nodes "too far behind"

| Atlantis (EIP-158/161/170) | 8,772,000 | ✅ | ✅ |
| Agharta (Constantinople) | 9,573,000 | ✅ | ✅ |
| Phoenix (Istanbul) | 10,500,839 | ✅ | ✅ |
| ECIP-1099 (Etchash) | 11,700,000 | ✅ | ✅ |
| Magneto (Berlin) | 13,189,133 | ✅ | ✅ |
| Mystique (London partial) | 14,525,000 | ✅ | ✅ |
| Spiral (Shanghai partial) | 19,250,000 | ✅ | ✅ |

**Result**: Configuration matches core-geth perfectly. ForkId calculation is correct.

## Current Behavior: Pure EIP-2124 ForkId Validation

Fukuii implements **pure EIP-2124 ForkId validation** with no workarounds. The ForkId is always calculated from the node's actual chain head (`ForkId.create()` in `src/main/scala/com/chipprbots/ethereum/forkid/ForkId.scala`):

- At block 0 (unsynced), ETC mainnet reports `ForkId(0xfc64ec04, Some(1150000))` — the CRC32 of the genesis hash, with Homestead (1,150,000) as the next fork. This matches core-geth's expected value for an unsynced node.
- As the node syncs past each fork block, the ForkId hash and `next` value advance per EIP-2124.
- A fully synced ETC mainnet node (past Spiral at 19,250,000) reports `ForkId(0xbe46d57c, None)`.

Per EIP-2124, remote peers must accept a node advertising the genesis ForkId as a stale-but-compatible peer that can still sync. No configuration is required.

### Understanding the Issue (Historical Context)

The ForkId mismatch issue occurred because:
1. **Our node** (at block 0) technically should report ForkId `0xfc64ec04, next: 1150000` per EIP-2124
2. **Peer nodes** (at block 19,250,000+) report ForkId `0xbe46d57c, next: None`
3. **Peers disconnected** with reason code 0x10 due to perceived incompatibility

This was a **peer-side strictness issue**. Our ForkId was (and is) correct per EIP-2124; some peer implementations were observed disconnecting nodes that were far behind, despite the spec requiring acceptance of stale-but-compatible peers.

### Optional Measures

The following measures are not required for ForkId compatibility, but may still be useful in some situations:

#### Bootstrap Checkpoints

Bootstrap checkpoints are still recommended for faster initial sync:

```hocon
# In etc-chain.conf (already enabled by default)
use-bootstrap-checkpoints = true
```

#### Manual Peer Connections (Optional)

If you experience connection issues, you can still add known-stable peers:

```hocon
# In application.conf
fukuii.network.peer {
  manual-connections = [
    "enode://fbcd6fc04fa7ea897558c3f5edf1cd192e3b2c3b5b9b3d00be179b2e9d04e623e017ed6ce6a1369fff126661afa1c5caa12febce92dcb70ff1352b86e9ebb44f@18.193.251.235:30303?discport=30303",
    "enode://1619217a01fb87a745bb104872aa84314a2d42d99c7b915cd187245bfd898d679cbf78b3ea950c32051db860e2c4e3fe7d6329107587be33ab37541ca65046f91@18.198.165.189:30303?discport=30303",
  ]
}
```

### Current Status

**Issue: RESOLVED** ✅

Fukuii reports the spec-correct EIP-2124 ForkId at every block height, including block 0. No configuration changes required.

### Verification

To verify ForkId reporting:

1. **Check ForkId at Startup**:
   ```bash
   ./bin/fukuii etc 2>&1 | grep "Sending status"
   ```
   At block 0, should show: `forkId=ForkId(0xfc64ec04, Some(1150000))` for ETC mainnet (the genesis ForkId per EIP-2124)

2. **Monitor Peer Connections**:
   ```bash
   ./bin/fukuii etc 2>&1 | grep -E "handshaked|disconnect"
   ```
   Should see sustained peer connections without immediate 0x10 disconnects

3. **Verify Sync Progress**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_syncing","params":[],"id":1}' http://localhost:8546
   ```
