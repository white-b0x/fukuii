/** Locks the behavior documented in [[Metrics.configure]] for multi-instance registration (Bug 29).
  *
  * These tests don't fix the shared-registry semantics — that requires an architectural refactor of the `object`-level
  * `MetricsContainer` singletons. What they DO is guarantee that the fallback contract (`Metrics.forInstance(unknownId)
  * \== Metrics.get()`) remains the observable API, so any change to the multi-instance wiring at least surfaces in this
  * test first.
  *
  * Avoids real port binding — we don't go through `configure` because it calls `Metrics.start()` which binds a real
  * Prometheus HTTP server. Port-binding tests belong in an integration suite with explicit lifecycle control; the Bug
  * 29 *semantic* we want to lock is the lookup fallback, which doesn't require binding.
