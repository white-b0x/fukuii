## What is Fukuii?

Fukuii is an EVM-compliant execution layer client built with Scala 3. Originating as a fork of Mantis for Ethereum Classic, it has evolved into a general-purpose EVM engine that participates in any consensus model via a pluggable three-layer architecture (`fukuii-core` / `fukuii-env` / consensus module — see [Pluggable Consensus Vision](architecture/pluggable-consensus-vision.md)). It provides:

- **Dual PoW/PoS operation** — Native Ethash mining for Ethereum Classic and Mordor, plus Engine API V1–V4 (through Prague/Electra) for post-Merge Ethereum networks paired with any CL client (Lighthouse, Prysm, Teku, Lodestar, Nimbus)
- **Full EVM through Prague/Electra** — All mainstream EIPs supported, including EIP-1559, EIP-3855 (PUSH0), EIP-4844 (blob transactions), EIP-4895 (withdrawals), EIP-4788 (beacon root), EIP-7685 (execution requests), plus ETC's ECIP-1066 hard-fork schedule through Olympia (ECIP-1111/1112/1121)
- **Multi-mode sync** — SNAP, fast, and regular sync for PoW chains; optimistic block import via Engine API for PoS chains
- **JSON-RPC API** — `eth_*`, `net_*`, `web3_*`, `debug_*`, `trace_*`, `admin_*`, `txpool_*`, `personal_*`, `engine_*` (authrpc), plus MCP 2025-11-25 for agentic AI control
- **Hive-verified compliance** — Full Ethereum Foundation Hive simulator suite (`smoke`, `rpc`, `graphql`, `devp2p`, `sync`, `consensus`, `pyspec`, `engine`, `consume-engine`, `consume-rlp`) runs per-simulator in CI
- **Docker support** — Production-ready container images with signed releases and SLSA provenance
- **Comprehensive monitoring** — Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, health/readiness endpoints
