# Testing Protocol

Test cadence for all agent sessions on the fukuii codebase. The full test suite
takes 24 minutes — running it between phases compounds into hours of stall time.
This protocol keeps feedback fast without sacrificing coverage.

## The three tiers (ADR-017)

| Command | What runs | Time | Baseline |
|---------|-----------|------|---------|
| `sbt testEssential` | 3,621 unit tests | ~24 min | 3,621 / 0 failures |
| `sbt testStandard` | Unit + integration | ~30 min | — |
| `sbt testComprehensive` | Full ethereum/tests compliance | <3 h | — |

---

## Per-phase cadence

### After EVERY file edit
```bash
sbt compile-all    # mandatory, fast — type errors surface immediately
```
Never batch multiple file edits before compiling. One file, one compile.

**Exception — core domain type sweeps:** see the dedicated section below.

### After formatting-only phases
(Returns removal, Messages.scala type additions, import cleanup)
```bash
sbt scalafmtAll    # formatting check — no tests needed, no logic changed
```
No tests. These phases change syntax only — compile is the full signal.

### After logic-changing phases
(Main migration, caller updates, behavior changes)
```bash
./local/scripts/fukuii-test <ActorNameSpec>          # actor-specific, seconds
./local/scripts/fukuii-test <SubsystemSuite>         # subsystem if callers touched
```
Run targeted tests only. Do not run testEssential here.

### Pre-push gate — before `git push origin`
```bash
./local/scripts/fukuii-test                          # full testEssential (~24 min)
```
Run exactly once before pushing to origin. This is the regression gate for a batch or PR.
Do not run it mid-thread or between phases — it is a 24-minute blocker.
Do not run it as a sanity check during a sprint; use targeted tests (`fukuii-test <Spec>`) instead.

## Core domain type sweeps

When a sweep touches a **heavily-imported domain type** — `BlockHeader`,
`Account`, `Block`, `Transaction`, or any type imported by >50 files — Zinc's
incremental compiler cascades the change through every dependent compilation
unit across all 12 modules. This is not a hang or a freeze: it is the expected
one-time cost of touching the most-depended-on types in the codebase.

### How to detect before starting

```bash
# Count files importing the type you are about to change
grep -rl "BlockHeader\b" src/ --include="*.scala" | wc -l   # e.g. 180+
grep -rl "Account\b"     src/ --include="*.scala" | wc -l   # e.g. 90+
```

If result > 50, you are in core domain sweep territory.

### Compile strategy during the sweep

Replace the per-file `sbt compile-all` with `sbt compile` (root main only):

```bash
sbt compile     # root main sources only — no test/IT/Benchmark modules
```

- The first `sbt compile` after touching a core type will be slow (1–3 min
  full cascade). Every subsequent compile in the same sweep is fast (incremental
  delta only, seconds).
- `sbt compile` still catches all type errors in main-source files — it is a
  complete signal for correctness of the changes.
- Test sources, IT, and Benchmark modules are excluded. They import the same
  types but do not need to recompile between each main-source edit.

At the very end of the sweep (all 18 / N files done):

```bash
sbt compile-all    # once — catches any issues in test/IT/Benchmark sources
```

### Root cause (why `compile-all` is slow here but not normally)

Normal changes touch leaf or mid-level files; Zinc's dependency graph is
shallow, so the cascade is small. Touching `BlockHeader` (or similar) is
touching the root of the dependency graph — every file that imports it must
recompile. `compile-all` includes test + IT + Benchmark sources, so the
cascade is 3–4× larger than root-main alone. Using `sbt compile` between
edits limits each cascade to main sources only; test sources recompile once
at the end.

### Affected types (known core domain, as of June 2026)

| Type | Location | Approx. dependents |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| `BlockHeader` | `domain/src/…/domain/blockchain/block/BlockHeader.scala` | 180+ |
| `Account` | `domain/src/…/domain/blockchain/state/Account.scala` | 90+ |
| `Block` | `domain/src/…/domain/blockchain/block/Block.scala` | 120+ |
| `Transaction` | `domain/src/…/domain/blockchain/transaction/Transaction.scala` | 100+ |

If you are unsure whether a type qualifies, run the grep above before starting.

## Targeted test patterns

```bash
# By actor name:
./local/scripts/fukuii-test AccountRangeCoordinatorSpec
./local/scripts/fukuii-test ByteCodeCoordinatorSpec

# By subsystem:
./local/scripts/fukuii-test SNAPSuite      # all SNAP tests (~263)
./local/scripts/fukuii-test NetworkSuite

# By tag (sbt native):
sbt testNetwork
sbt testRLP
sbt testCrypto
sbt testVM
```

## Format commands

| Command | What it does | When to use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `sbt scalafmtAll` | scalafmt across ALL modules | After every commit during migrations |
| `sbt scalafmt` | scalafmt ROOT module only | **Never** — misses submodules |
| `sbt formatAll` | scalafixAll + scalafmtAll | Pre-PR on clean codebase ONLY |
| `sbt scalafmtAll` ≠ `sbt formatAll` | formatAll runs scalafix | formatAll aborts on pre-existing violations |

---

## What "baseline holds" means

The thread-end `testEssential` run must show:
- Test count: **3,621** (not fewer — a missing test class = silent deletion)
- Failures: **0**
- If count drops: investigate before closing the thread

**Per-thread delta tracking:** Before starting any migration or sweep thread, record
the current test count from the most recent `testEssential` run (see the test quality
log at `.local/docs/test-quality-log.md` for the last known baseline). At thread end,
compare. A negative delta — even by 1 — means a test class was silently deleted or a
`@Test` annotation was dropped. This commonly happens when a Classic actor spec is
deleted during migration but no Typed replacement spec is written. Investigate before
closing; do not accept a lower count as the new baseline without a recorded reason.

---

## Inline test standards (when writing new tests)

- No `Thread.sleep` — use `eventually(...)` or `TestProbe.expectMsg(duration)`
- No `@Ignore` without a one-line comment explaining the gate condition
- Deterministic: same result on every machine and CI run
- Each test covers one behavior — not a scenario script
- New tests for migrated actors: use `ActorTestKit` (Typed), not `TestActorRef` (Classic)

---

## Protocol for failing tests after migration

1. Run targeted test first: `./local/scripts/fukuii-test <FailingSpec>`
2. Read the failure — understand it before touching anything
3. If failure is in the migrated actor: fix the migration, not the test
4. If failure is in a test that tests Classic behavior: update the test for Typed API
5. If failure is in an unrelated test: note it, do not fix it (out of scope), surface to user
6. Never modify a test to make it pass without understanding why it failed
