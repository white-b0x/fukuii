# Pekko Typed API Protocol

<!-- currency: verified idiomatic for Scala 3.3.8 LTS / Pekko 1.6.0 — 2026-07-03 -->

Preferred patterns for Pekko Typed actors in the fukuii codebase. Applied when
writing new actors, migrating Classic actors (LOOM), and reviewing existing Typed
code (PRISM). Each preference has a grep pattern for regression detection.

Used by: LOOM (primary), PRISM, MITHRIL

---

## Migration state context

The codebase is mid-migration from Classic to Typed. During migration, Classic
adapters (`.toClassic`, `PropsAdapter`, `Behavior[Any]`) are intentional scaffolding —
do not flag them as violations until CAPSTONE. Post-CAPSTONE, all of the below
apply universally.

**Mechanical shortcut:** ~20 of the greps below (excluding checks that need a specific
actor/file name as a parameter) run in one call instead of one at a time:

```bash
scripts/agent-tooling/lib/pekko-typed-check.sh
```

Reports enforced-now checks (target 0), informational checks (review each hit),
cross-reference checks (P19, P23, P24), and the CAPSTONE-only sweep separately —
CAPSTONE section counts are expected nonzero during migration, not current regressions.

---

## P1 — `Behaviors.withTimers` over raw scheduler

**Status:** Enforced in all migrated actors.

```bash
grep -rn "context\.system\.scheduler\|system\.scheduler" src/main/ --include="*.scala" \
  | grep -v "//\|test\|Classic\|\.toClassic"
# Target: 0 hits in Typed actors
```

**Prefer:**
```scala
Behaviors.withTimers { timers =>
  timers.startTimerWithFixedDelay("key", Tick, 30.seconds)
  timers.startSingleTimer("key", CheckCompletion, 100.millis)
  // timers cancel automatically on behavior stop
}
```

**Avoid:**
```scala
val task = context.system.scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(...)  // manual cancellation required
task.cancel()  // in postStop — easy to forget
```

---

## P2 — `PostStop` signal over `preStop` lifecycle hook

**Status:** Enforced in migrated actors.

```bash
grep -rn "override def preStop\|override def postStop" src/main/ --include="*.scala" \
  | grep -v "//\|extends Actor"  # Classic actors legitimately use these
```

**Prefer:**
```scala
Behaviors.receiveMessage[Command] { ... }
  .receiveSignal {
    case (ctx, PostStop) =>
      cleanup()
      Behaviors.same
  }
```

---

## P3 — Explicit `replyTo` over `sender()`

**Status:** Enforced in migrated actors. Zero tolerance in new Typed code.

```bash
grep -rn "sender()" src/main/ --include="*.scala" | grep -v "extends Actor\|//\|test"
# Target: 0 hits in Typed actors
```

**Pattern:** Request carries its own reply address.
```scala
case class GetStatus(replyTo: ActorRef[StatusResponse]) extends Command
// Handler:
case GetStatus(replyTo) => replyTo ! StatusResponse(currentStatus)
```

---

## P4 — Named child actors

**Status:** Recommended for new code.

```scala
// ✅ Named — visible in logs, dead letters, actor hierarchy
ctx.spawn(WorkerActor(config), s"worker-${task.id}")

// ❌ Anonymous — invisible in diagnostics
ctx.spawn(WorkerActor(config), "")
```

Name format: `<role>-<discriminator>` where discriminator is stable (task ID, address hash, index).
Do not use random UUIDs — logs become useless.

---

## P5 — AskPattern for request-response across Classic boundary

When a Classic actor needs a response from a Typed actor:

```scala
import org.apache.pekko.actor.typed.scaladsl.AskPattern._
implicit val timeout: Timeout = 5.seconds

val result: Future[Response] =
  typedRef.ask(replyTo => TypedCommand(replyTo))(timeout, system.scheduler)
```

When a Typed actor needs a response from a Classic actor (avoid if possible — prefer migrating the Classic side):
```scala
context.ask(classicRef.toTyped[ClassicCommand])(replyTo => ClassicCommand(replyTo)) {
  case Success(r) => AdaptedResponse(r)
  case Failure(e) => RequestFailed(e)
}
```

---

## P6 — Two-behavior pattern for state machines

Classic `context.become` → return next behavior from message handler.

```scala
def receive(): Behavior[Command] =
  Behaviors.receiveMessage {
    case Start => working()     // transition by returning new behavior
    case other => Behaviors.unhandled
  }

def working(): Behavior[Command] =
  Behaviors.receiveMessage {
    case Complete => receive()  // back to initial
    case other => Behaviors.unhandled
  }
```

PostStop signal attaches to each behavior independently if cleanup differs per state.

---

## P7 — Non-sealed Command ADT when spanning files

When Command cases are defined in a shared `Messages.scala` across package boundaries,
Scala 3 cannot seal the trait. This is by design in the S3 coordinator group.

```scala
// In coordinator companion:
trait Command  // non-sealed — intentional, multi-file constraint

// In Messages.scala (different package):
case class GetProgress(replyTo: ActorRef[ProgressReport]) extends CoordinatorName.Command
```

Document with a comment: `// non-sealed: cases in Messages.scala span package boundary`
Post-CAPSTONE, consolidate into companion objects and seal (Part 7a).

---

## P8 — `Behaviors.setup` for initialization side effects

```scala
// ✅ Side effects in setup, not in apply()
def apply(config: Config): Behavior[Command] =
  Behaviors.setup { ctx =>
    ctx.log.info("Starting with config {}", config)
    val resource = openResource(config)
    new ActorImpl(ctx, resource).receive()
  }

// ❌ Side effects at object construction time
object MyActor {
  val resource = openResource(globalConfig)  // runs at class load, untestable
```

---

## P9 — `context.watchWith` over `context.watch` + `Terminated`

```scala
// ✅ Typed — message carries identity
ctx.watchWith(child, ChildStopped(child.path.name))

// ❌ Classic-style in Typed code
ctx.watch(child)  // then: case Terminated(ref) => ...  (weaker typing)
```

**Migration check — Classic peers that expected `Terminated`:**

When migrating `context.watch` → `context.watchWith`, grep for Classic callers that
relied on receiving `Terminated` from this actor's watched children as a lifecycle signal:

```bash
grep -rn "Terminated" src/main/ --include="*.scala" | grep -i "ActorName\|ChildName"
```

Classic actors watching a peer received `Terminated` automatically via the death watch
system. After migrating to `watchWith`, the Typed actor sends a specific Command
(e.g., `ChildStopped`) instead — `Terminated` is no longer propagated. Any Classic
peer that relied on `Terminated` for lifecycle coordination must be updated or given
an adapter. Add a Chase entry to `.claude/sprints/QUEUE.md` for each such caller not in scope.

---

## P10 — Internal Commands for Future → actor-state writes

When a Future needs to communicate a decision that mutates actor state, create
dedicated internal Commands to marshal the result back to the actor thread. Do
not share mutable state via `@volatile` or other synchronization — that is the
Classic workaround, not the Typed pattern.

**Pattern (from TNHC `verificationBFSRunning`):**

```scala
// ❌ Classic workaround — @volatile on shared actor state
@volatile var verificationRunning: Boolean = false  // race with Future writes

// ✅ Typed — Future sends a Command, actor writes state on-thread
private case object RestartResumeVerification extends Command
private case object RestartFullRebuild        extends Command

// Before launching Future, capture selfRef:
val selfRef = context.self
crashRecoveryFuture.onComplete {
  case Success(canResume) =>
    if (canResume) selfRef ! RestartResumeVerification
    else           selfRef ! RestartFullRebuild
  case Failure(_) => selfRef ! RestartFullRebuild
}(recoveryEc)

// In behavior — state written only on actor thread:
case RestartResumeVerification =>
  verificationRunning = true   // safe: actor thread, plain var
  resumeVerification()
  Behaviors.same
```

**Pre-migration checklist addition:** Before migrating any Classic actor, grep for
`@volatile` fields. Each site requires internal Command pairs in the Typed version —
one per logical decision the Future can make.

```bash
grep -n "@volatile" src/main/scala/com/chipprbots/ethereum/...ActorFile.scala
```

**CAPSTONE sweep:**
```bash
grep -rn "@volatile" src/main/ --include="*.scala" | grep -v "extends Actor\b"
# Target: 0 hits in Typed actors post-migration
```

---

## P11 — `asyncLog` (plain SLF4J) for off-thread code

`context.log` is only safe on the actor thread. Calling it from inside a Future,
CE IO computation, BFS walk, or worker closure violates Pekko's thread-safety contract
on `ActorContext`. The violation is often silent — code compiles, but tests fail
selectively depending on which code paths trigger the log call and under what thread
scheduling. The error manifests as a runtime exception from inside `ActorContext`,
not a compile error.

**S4 migration bug (io-compute thread variant):** `processNodes` was a `private def`
containing `ctx.log.debug(...)`. The method was invoked from within a CE IO computation
running on `io-compute-2`. Tests for `FullResponse` and `PartialResponse` passed because
those paths never hit the `ctx.log` call. Only the `RequestFailed` branch triggered it,
and only then did the actor context access blow up — making the bug appear specific to one
message type when the root cause was the CE thread boundary.

**Rule:** Any code that executes on a non-actor thread must use `asyncLog`. This includes:
- `Future { }` bodies and `.map`, `.flatMap`, `.recover`, `.onComplete` callbacks
- `IO { }` bodies and any Cats Effect `.flatMap`, `.map`, `.evalMap` chain
- BFS / traversal callbacks passed to a non-actor `ExecutionContext`
- Any `private def` that is called from within any of the above (indirect violation)

The indirect case is the most dangerous: a `private def` using `ctx.log` looks fine at its
definition site but becomes a violation the moment any caller invokes it from a CE fiber or
Future callback. Defaulting `private def` helpers that do logging to `asyncLog` avoids this
entirely.

**Pattern (from TNHC BFS + S4 CE IO fix):**

```scala
// Declare alongside ctx — safe from any thread:
private val asyncLog = LoggerFactory.getLogger(getClass)

// ❌ private def with ctx.log — unsafe if called from CE IO or Future:
private def processNodes(nodes: List[Node]): Unit =
  nodes.foreach { n =>
    ctx.log.debug("Processing node: {}", n.hash)  // blows up on io-compute thread
  }

// ✅ Use asyncLog in any private def that may run off the actor thread:
private def processNodes(nodes: List[Node]): Unit =
  nodes.foreach { n =>
    asyncLog.debug("Processing node: {}", n.hash)  // safe from any thread
  }

// ✅ Actor-thread message handlers: ctx.log is fine here
case StartPhase(pivot) =>
  ctx.log.info("Phase started: pivot={}", pivot)
```

**Sweeps — run during pre-migration checklist and after each migration:**

```bash
# Direct violation: ctx.log inside a CE IO block
grep -rn "IO\s*{" src/main/ --include="*.scala" -A30 | grep "ctx\.log\|context\.log"

# Direct violation: ctx.log inside Future/callback closures
grep -rn "ctx\.log\|context\.log" src/main/ --include="*.scala" -B5 \
  | grep -B5 "Future\|onComplete\|\.map\|\.flatMap\|\.recover"

# Indirect risk: private defs in Typed actor files that use ctx.log
# Manual review required — check if any are called from IO / Future chains
grep -rn "private def" src/main/ --include="*.scala" -A20 \
  | grep "ctx\.log\|context\.log"
```

---

## P12 — `mapMaterializedValue` over `preMaterialize` for subscription setup

**Status:** Enforced after CAPSTONE. `preMaterialize()` in streaming subscription setup is forbidden.

**Root cause (CAPSTONE bug, `bc2a7a2fc`):** `Source.fromMaterializer { (mat, _) => val (ref, src) = Source.actorRef(...).preMaterialize()(mat); ... src }` creates a Reactive Streams Publisher/Subscriber async boundary via `Sink.asPublisher(false)`. Under Pekko 1.6.0, elements pushed by the `actorRef` source don't reach downstream consumers through this boundary. `take(N).runWith(Sink.seq).futureValue` hangs indefinitely.

**Anti-pattern — async boundary, never use for subscription setup:**
```scala
// ❌ preMaterialize() = hidden Publisher/Subscriber boundary = elements silently dropped
def messageSource(pea: TypedActorRef[Command], mc: MessageClassifier): Source[Msg, NotUsed] =
  Source
    .fromMaterializer { (mat, _) =>
      val (actorRef, src) = Source.actorRef[Msg](...).watch(pea.toClassic).preMaterialize()(mat)
      pea ! SubscribeCmd(mc, actorRef)
      src
    }
    .mapMaterializedValue(_ => NotUsed)
```

**Pattern — single graph materialization:**
```scala
// ✅ mapMaterializedValue fires at graph materialization — no async boundary
def messageSource(pea: TypedActorRef[Command], mc: MessageClassifier): Source[Msg, NotUsed] =
  Source
    .actorRef[Msg](PartialFunction.empty, PartialFunction.empty, 64, OverflowStrategy.dropHead)
    .watch(pea.toClassic)
    .mapMaterializedValue { actorRef =>
      pea ! SubscribeCmd(mc, actorRef)
      NotUsed
    }
```

**Sweep:**
```bash
grep -rn "preMaterialize\|fromMaterializer" src/ --include="*.scala"
# Legitimate uses of fromMaterializer: acquiring the Materializer for downstream ops.
# Illegitimate use: calling preMaterialize() inside fromMaterializer to "eagerly" subscribe.
# When in doubt: ask whether a simpler mapMaterializedValue achieves the same result.
```

## P13 — Stream test synchronization: syncProbe barrier + `take(N)`

**Status:** Established pattern after CAPSTONE. Do not use `Await.result` + `PoisonPill` for stream termination in tests.

**The problem with PoisonPill termination:**
1. `pea.toClassic ! PoisonPill` sends a system message with priority over regular mailbox messages.
2. Pekko delivers system messages (including `Terminated`) before pending regular messages.
3. Stream actors may have buffered elements that haven't been forwarded downstream when termination arrives.
4. `Await.result(stream, timeout)` succeeds but the seq is incomplete or never arrived.

**The problem with `Await.result` + fixed timeout:**
- Brittle under load (NUC at full testEssential load) — 5s timeout can expire.
- Hides ordering bugs: if elements arrived but the future completed before assertion, test passes incorrectly.

**Pattern — demand-driven self-termination with FIFO barrier:**
```scala
// Subscribe streams FIRST (mapMaterializedValue fires synchronously at runWith):
val stream1 = PeerEventBusActor.messageSource(pea, classifier1).take(1).runWith(Sink.seq)
val stream2 = PeerEventBusActor.messageSource(pea, classifier2).take(2).runWith(Sink.seq)

// FIFO barrier: subscribe syncProbe AFTER stream subscriptions (same test thread).
// When syncProbe.expectMsg confirms receipt, all earlier PEA mailbox messages (the
// stream SubscribeCmds + PublishCmd) have been processed — FIFO guarantee.
val syncProbe = TestProbe()
pea ! SubscribeCmd(classifier2, syncProbe.ref)

pea ! PublishCmd(msg1)
syncProbe.expectMsg(msg1)      // ← barrier: confirms msg1 delivered to all classifier2 subs

pea ! PublishCmd(msg2)
syncProbe.expectMsg(msg2)      // ← barrier: confirms msg2 delivered

// Elements are buffered; Futures complete as soon as take(N) demand is satisfied:
stream1.futureValue shouldEqual Seq(msg1)
stream2.futureValue shouldEqual Seq(msg1, msg2)
```

**Why this works:**
- `take(N).runWith(Sink.seq)` is demand-driven — the Future completes the moment N elements are delivered, with no termination race.
- `syncProbe` subscribed last from the test thread → PEA processes SubscribeCmds in FIFO order → by the time `syncProbe.expectMsg` returns, all stream actors have their elements buffered.
- `ScalaFutures.futureValue` (from `with ScalaFutures with NormalPatience`) is non-timeout-race-sensitive because the elements are already in the buffer.

**NEVER in stream tests:**
```scala
// ❌ PoisonPill races with buffered elements
pea.toClassic ! PoisonPill
Await.result(stream, 5.seconds)  // may be incomplete

// ❌ Fixed sleep before assertion
Thread.sleep(500)
stream.futureValue  // timing-dependent

// ❌ Await without a synchronization barrier
Await.result(stream, 5.seconds)  // may time out under load
```

## Test-kit pitfalls (discovered §8a-retro batch 4, 2026-06-23)

**P14 — Missing `application-test.conf` causes `ConfigurationException` with bare ctor**

`ScalaTestWithActorTestKit()` (bare ctor) loads `application-test.conf` from the classpath. If it doesn't exist, Pekko falls back to jar-bundled `reference.conf` only — which does **not** include `src/test/resources/application.conf`. Any actor spawned with `withDispatcherFromConfig("sync-dispatcher")` throws `ConfigurationException: Dispatcher [sync-dispatcher] not configured`.

**Proper fix:** Create `src/test/resources/application-test.conf` (§8a-infra backlog item):
```hocon
include "application.conf"
pekko.actor.default-dispatcher.throughput = 1
```

**Fixed in `8b9bef67d` (2026-06-23):** `src/test/resources/application-test.conf` created; `ConfigFactory.load()` stripped from 25 specs. Bare ctor now works.

---

**P15 — `testKit.stop` is a silent no-op for classic-resolved worker children**

`testKit.stop(ref)` only terminates actors returned by `testKit.spawn(...)`. Coordinator workers are spawned internally via classic `context.actorOf` and resolved by tests via `actorSelection` — these hold classic `ActorRef` values. Calling `testKit.stop` on them does nothing, leaving workers running between tests.

**Proper fix:** Audit affected specs and add `testKit.system.classicSystem.stop(workerRef)` in teardown for classic-resolved refs, OR verify the coordinator's own `PostStop` handler stops workers (§8a-infra-b backlog item).

---

## Anti-patterns — flag in PRISM review

| Pattern | Problem | Correct |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `sender()` in Typed actor | Not available — compile error | Explicit `replyTo` in Command |
| `Behavior[Any]` in permanent code | Defeats type safety | Typed Command ADT |
| `.toClassic` outside migration scaffolding | Classic leak post-CAPSTONE | Full migration |
| `context.system.scheduler` in Typed actor | Manual lifecycle | `withTimers` |
| Unnamed child actors | Invisible in diagnostics | Named with stable discriminator |
| `preStop` / `postStop` override in Typed | Classic API | `PostStop` signal |
| `ScalaTestWithActorTestKit()` bare ctor without `application-test.conf` | `sync-dispatcher` not found → `ConfigurationException` | Create `application-test.conf` (P14 / §8a-infra) |
| `testKit.stop(classicWorkerRef)` | Silent no-op; worker resource leak | `testKit.system.classicSystem.stop(workerRef)` (P15 / §8a-infra-b) |

---

## P16 — Constructor params must use `ActorRef[T]`, not Classic `ActorRef`

**Status:** Enforced in all migrated actors. The single most common source of spawn-site `.toClassic` slippage.

When a Typed actor is spawned by another Typed actor, every constructor param that holds a ref to another
actor must use `typed.ActorRef[T]`, not Classic `ActorRef`. A Classic param forces the spawning caller to
write `typedRef.toClassic` at the spawn site — the bridge is invisible to the type checker but real tech debt.

```bash
# Find Typed actors with Classic ActorRef constructor params (grep the constructor line)
# NOTE: literal "(" in BRE grep is unescaped — "\(" starts a group and throws
# "Unmatched ( or \(" here, which silently produces 0 matches (false pass) if the
# error is missed. Caught 2026-07-02 building pekko-typed-check.sh.
grep -rn "class.*(.*ActorRef\b" src/main/ --include="*.scala" \
  | grep -v "typed\.ActorRef\|ActorRef\[" \
  | grep -v "//.*ActorRef"
# Target: 0 hits in fully-migrated Typed actors
```

**During a LOOM migration** (pre-CAPSTONE): updating constructor params is MANDATORY as part of the
migration commit — not deferred. For each Classic `ActorRef` param:
1. Change the param type to `ActorRef[T]` where T is the most specific message type the actor sends to it.
   Use `ActorRef[Any]` only when the actor sends multiple unrelated types through a message adapter.
2. Update internal usages — the `!` operator works identically on Classic and Typed refs; type changes only.
3. Update all spawn sites to drop `.toClassic` at the call site.
4. If a spawn site is in a file out of scope for this LOOM session, add a Chase entry to `.claude/sprints/QUEUE.md` (type: CLASSIC).

**Do NOT close a LOOM migration with Classic `ActorRef` params remaining.** If a param truly cannot be
updated yet (e.g., because a shared command ADT is not owned by this actor), add the Chase entry
and document the gate condition.

**Prefer:**
```scala
// Typed actor with typed refs — callers spawn cleanly, no .toClassic needed
class FastSync(
  syncController: ActorRef[SyncController.Command],  // ✅ typed
  peerManager: ActorRef[PeerManagerActor.Command],   // ✅ typed
  ...
)
```

**Avoid:**
```scala
// Classic params survive migration — force callers to write .toClassic forever
class FastSync(
  syncController: ActorRef,  // ❌ Classic — every spawn site adds .toClassic
  peerManager: ActorRef,     // ❌ Classic
  ...
)
```

---

---

## P17 — `messageAdapter` in `Behaviors.setup` only, never inside receive

**Status:** Violation confirmed — `PeersClient.scala:224` creates a new adapter per `RequestPeer` message.

Pekko docs: "one adapter per message class, last registration wins." Creating an adapter inside a receive handler silently replaces the previous one on every message. With multiple in-flight requests, the second registration discards the first adapter — responses for request A get misrouted to request B's handler.

```bash
grep -rn "messageAdapter\[" src/main/ --include="*.scala"
# All hits must be inside Behaviors.setup blocks, not case branches
```

When per-request reply routing is needed: use `context.ask` (designed for one-shot request/response, safe under concurrent in-flight calls) or embed a correlation ID into the result type and use a single setup-level adapter.

---

## P18 — `spawnAnonymous` only for truly identity-free workers; prefer named

**Status:** 6 violations — `ByteCodeCoordinator`, `AccountRangeCoordinator`, `SyncStateSchedulerActor`, `BlockImporter`, `FastSyncBranchResolverActor`.

`spawnAnonymous` is correct only when a worker has no stable identity and no parent needs to correlate its termination to specific work. Use a named actor with a discriminator when the parent `watchWith`'s the child or needs traceable log output.

```scala
// ✅ Named with stable counter
private var n = 0
def spawnWorker(): ActorRef[WorkerCmd] =
  context.spawn(Worker(config), s"bytecode-worker-${n += 1; n}")
```

```bash
grep -rn "spawnAnonymous" src/main/ --include="*.scala"
# Review each: does the parent watchWith it? If yes, name it.
```

---

## P19 — `PreRestart` signal handler required when `Behaviors.supervise` is present

**Status:** Zero `PreRestart` handlers in the codebase. Two supervised actors exist (`FastSync`, `FaucetSupervisor`).

`PreRestart` fires before the new behavior instance starts, giving the crashing behavior one chance to release resources (subscriptions, open connections, messageAdapter refs). `PostStop` fires on permanent termination only. An actor under `restartWithBackoff` that opens a subscription in `Behaviors.setup` leaks one subscription per crash if `PreRestart` does not unsubscribe.

```bash
grep -rn "Behaviors\.supervise\|\.onFailure\[" src/main/ --include="*.scala" -l
# Each file must also contain PreRestart:
grep -rn "PreRestart" src/main/ --include="*.scala"
```

---

## P20 — `Behaviors.supervise` restart strategy must include `.withLimit` or backoff

**Status:** `FastSync.scala:425` uses unlimited `SupervisorStrategy.restart` — no bound.

Unlimited restart causes infinite loops on persistent failures (codec bug, bad peer message). For I/O-bound actors prefer `restartWithBackoff`; for local workers use `.withLimit`.

```scala
// ✅ Bounded backoff — operational visibility via withCriticalLogLevel
Behaviors.supervise(behavior).onFailure[Exception](
  SupervisorStrategy
    .restartWithBackoff(100.millis, 10.seconds, randomFactor = 0.2)
    .withMaxRestarts(10)
    .withCriticalLogLevel(Level.ERROR, afterErrors = 3)
)
```

Exception: `SupervisorStrategy.stop` on a domain exception that means the actor must not continue — no limit needed.

```bash
grep -rn "SupervisorStrategy\.restart\b" src/main/ --include="*.scala" \
  | grep -v "withLimit\|restartWithBackoff\|WithLimit"
# Target: 0 hits
```

---

## P21 — `ChildFailed` signal to capture crash cause from direct children

**Status:** Zero uses in the codebase.

`ChildFailed <: Terminated` is emitted when a **direct unsupervised child** crashes. It carries the `cause: Throwable`. Use `watch(child)` + `ChildFailed` match in `receiveSignal` when the coordinator needs to distinguish crash from clean stop and log the exception.

**Important:** `ChildFailed` only arrives for direct children without a `Behaviors.supervise` wrapper. If the child has a supervisor, the parent sees `Terminated` after max-restarts is exceeded.

```bash
grep -rn "watchWith\|Terminated\b" src/main/ --include="*.scala" -l
# Review each: would knowing the crash cause aid debugging? If yes, use watch + ChildFailed.
```

---

## P22 — `Behaviors.withMdc` for per-actor structured logging context

**Status:** Not used. All MDC is manual (`Logger.scala:22–24`) — unsafe on actor threads.

`Behaviors.withMdc` injects MDC automatically before each message and clears it after. It integrates with `context.log` (actor-thread-safe). Manual `MDC.put`/`MDC.clear` pairs called from actor code are not thread-safe and silently produce incorrect MDC under load.

```scala
def apply(peerId: PeerId): Behavior[Command] =
  Behaviors.withMdc[Command](
    staticMdc = Map("peerId" -> peerId.value, "chainId" -> "61")
  )(Behaviors.setup { ctx => ... })
```

Highest-value targets: `PeerActor`, `PeerRequestHandler`, `SNAPSyncController` — adding `peerId` as static MDC makes peer-session log correlation trivial.

```bash
grep -rn "org\.slf4j\.MDC\|MDC\.put\|MDC\.clear" src/main/ --include="*.scala"
# Target: 0 hits in Typed actors — replace with Behaviors.withMdc
```

---

## P23 — `ManualTime` for all tests that exercise `withTimers` behavior

**Status:** Partially enforced — `PeerRequestHandlerSpec`, `FilterManagerSpec` use it. `SNAPSyncController`, `BlockchainHostActor` tests do not.

Tests using real wall-clock time for timer assertions are flaky on the NUC under `testEssential` load (24 min, high CPU contention). `ManualTime` provides deterministic timer control.

```bash
grep -rn "withTimers\|startTimerWithFixedDelay\|startSingleTimer" src/test/ --include="*.scala" -l \
  | xargs grep -L "ManualTime"
# Target: 0 hits — all timer specs must use ManualTime
```

---

## P24 — `LoggingTestKit` assertions for supervised actor crash paths

**Status:** Only `PoWMiningCoordinatorSpec` uses it. `FastSync` and `FaucetSupervisor` have no log-level tests.

`LoggingTestKit` verifies log events are emitted at the expected level. Use it to assert ERROR logging on crash, WARN on recovery, and absence of unexpected errors in the happy path.

```bash
grep -rn "Behaviors\.supervise\|onFailure\[" src/main/ --include="*.scala" -l \
  | while read f; do
      base=$(basename "$f" .scala)
      grep -rn "LoggingTestKit" src/test/ --include="*${base}Spec*" &>/dev/null \
        || echo "MISSING: $base"
    done
# Target: each supervised actor spec contains at least one LoggingTestKit assertion
```

---

## P25 — `ActorRef.narrow` for interface segregation over `messageAdapter`

**Status:** Used once (`RegularSync.scala:73`). Should be standard for coordinators exposing sub-protocols to children.

`narrow[U]` (where `U <: T`) is a zero-cost cast — no wrapping, no new ActorRef. Prefer it over `messageAdapter` when the child's reply type is already a subtype of the coordinator's Command. Use `messageAdapter` only when transformation is needed.

```bash
grep -rn "messageAdapter\[" src/main/ --include="*.scala"
# For each: is the mapped type a subtype of Command? If yes, prefer .narrow[U] instead.
grep -rn "\.narrow\[" src/main/ --include="*.scala"
# Expect: one per coordinator actor that exposes a sub-protocol to children
```

---

## P26 — Never block on a `Future` inside actor message handling or a Pekko dispatcher thread

**Status:** No known production violations as of 2026-07; documented preemptively — this is
the Pekko/Scala analog of the C#/.NET `.Result`/`.Wait()` deadlock warning, and the pattern
this codebase is actively migrating *toward* (Pekko Typed, `pipeToSelf`) makes it easy to
backslide into if a migrated actor still calls out to a blocking API.

`scala.concurrent.Await.result`/`Await.ready` on a `Future` from inside an actor's message
handler (or any code running on a Pekko dispatcher thread) starves that dispatcher — under
load this deadlocks the actor system, not just the one actor, since dispatchers are shared
thread pools. This is distinct from P13's `Await.result` discussion, which is about test
*synchronization reliability* (incomplete results under a timeout); this entry is about
*production dispatcher starvation*. Use `context.pipeToSelf` (P10) to turn the `Future`'s
result into a message instead of blocking for it.

```bash
grep -rn "Await\.\(result\|ready\)" src/main/ --include="*.scala" | grep -v "src/test/\|src/it/"
# Any hit outside test/IT sources is a dispatcher-starvation risk — investigate before accepting
```

## TL1 — `IORuntime.global` only at the composition root (`NodeApp`)

**Status:** 26 actor files use `given IORuntime = IORuntime.global`. Only `DiscoveryServiceBuilder` correctly accepts `IORuntime` as a constructor parameter.

Each actor reaching for the global runtime independently makes coordinated shutdown metrics impossible and creates hidden coupling. Wire `IORuntime` once at `NodeApp` and pass it down as a constructor implicit.

```bash
grep -rn "IORuntime\.global" src/main/ --include="*.scala" | grep -v "NodeApp\|DiscoveryService"
# Target: 0 hits — all non-root uses should accept IORuntime as a constructor param
```

## TL2 — `unsafeRunSync` only at composition root and test code

**Status:** 4 actionable violations in production storage and RPC code.

`unsafeRunSync` blocks the calling thread — in actor message handlers this starves the dispatcher; in storage methods called from actor handlers it deadlocks under backpressure. Known violations:
- `HealingFrontierStorage.scala:43`
- `PathNodeStorage.scala:146, 156`
- `JsonRpcIpcServer.scala:104`

Fix: actor callers use `pipeToSelf`; IPC server uses `Dispatcher.sequential` scoped to a `Resource`.

```bash
grep -rn "unsafeRunSync" src/main/ --include="*.scala" | grep -v "//\|Benchmark\|NodeApp\|Main"
# Each hit is a production thread-blocking risk — investigate before accepting
```

## CAPSTONE cleanup targets

After all actors are Typed, sweep for:
```bash
grep -rn "\.toClassic\b" src/main/ --include="*.scala"        # remove adapters
grep -rn "PropsAdapter\b" src/main/ --include="*.scala"       # remove adapters
grep -rn "Behavior\[Any\]" src/main/ --include="*.scala"      # narrow to real type
grep -rn "ActorSystem\b" src/main/ --include="*.scala"        # flip to ActorSystem[Nothing]
grep -rn "@volatile" src/main/ --include="*.scala"            # should be 0 in Typed actors (P10)
grep -rn "IO\s*{" src/main/ --include="*.scala" -A30 \
  | grep "ctx\.log\|context\.log"                             # P11: CE IO thread violation
grep -rn "ctx\.log\|context\.log" src/main/ --include="*.scala" -B5 \
  | grep -B5 "Future\|onComplete\|\.map\|flatMap\|\.recover"  # P11: Future thread violation
```
