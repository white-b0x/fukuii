# Protocol Version Alignment - Implementation Summary

## Issue

The problem statement requested:
> "we need to align the protocol versions and understand why they eth 65 is being selected, we should evaluate the entire decode flow to ensure all capabilities are up to date and compatiable with geth"

## Root Cause Analysis

Fukuii was only advertising **ETH68** and **SNAP1** as supported capabilities, based on an incorrect assumption that only the highest protocol version should be advertised. This caused several issues:

1. **Incompatible with Geth's behavior**: Geth advertised multiple versions (at the time, eth/66, eth/67, eth/68, snap/1; current releases advertise eth/68, eth/69, snap/1)
2. **Negotiation failures**: When peers advertised only ETH65 or ETH66, negotiation would fail or produce unexpected results
3. **Unclear protocol selection**: Without proper logging, it was unclear why certain protocol versions were being selected

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Advertised Capabilities

**Before:**
```scala
val supportedCapabilities: List[Capability] = List(Capability.ETH68, Capability.SNAP1)
```

**After:**
```scala
val supportedCapabilities: List[Capability] = List(
  Capability.ETH68,
  Capability.ETH69,
  Capability.SNAP1
)
```

This aligns with Geth's approach (current Geth releases advertise `eth/68`, `eth/69`, `snap/1`) and ensures proper negotiation with peers supporting any of these protocol versions. ETH63-67 are no longer advertised: the live peer set negotiates ETH68+, and ETH68 removed `GetNodeData`/`NodeData` in favour of SNAP.

### 2. Enhanced Protocol Negotiation Logging

Added comprehensive logging to track capability negotiation:

```scala
log.info("PEER_CAPABILITIES: clientId={}, p2pVersion={}, capabilities=[{}]", ...)
log.info("OUR_CAPABILITIES: capabilities=[{}]", ...)
log.info("CAPABILITY_NEGOTIATION: peerCaps=[{}], ourCaps=[{}], negotiated={}", ...)
log.info("PROTOCOL_NEGOTIATED: clientId={}, protocol={}, usesRequestId={}", ...)
```

This makes it easy to diagnose why a particular protocol version was selected.

### 3. Documentation

Created two comprehensive documents:

- **docs/architecture/PROTOCOL_CAPABILITY_NEGOTIATION.md**: Explains the negotiation algorithm, protocol differences, and how RequestId wrapping works
- **docs/troubleshooting/PROTOCOL_VERSION_SELECTION.md**: Quick reference guide for understanding why specific protocol versions are selected

## Why ETH 65 Was Being Selected (historical)

When "eth/65 is being selected" was observed, it was because:

1. The peer only advertised support for ETH65 (or lower)
2. Negotiation correctly selected the highest common version
3. Both sides could communicate using ETH65

That was expected behavior **while ETH65-67 were still advertised**. With the current
capability set (ETH68, ETH69, SNAP1), peers advertising only eth/67 or below have no common
version with us and are disconnected during negotiation instead.

## Protocol Compatibility Matrix

| Our Version | Peer Versions | Negotiated | RequestId | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|------------|-----------|-------|
| ETH68-69 | eth/68 | eth/68 | Yes | Highest common version |
| ETH68-69 | eth/68, eth/69 | eth/69 | Yes | Latest protocol, optimal |
| ETH68-69 | eth/66, eth/67 | — | — | No common version, peer disconnected |
| ETH68-69 | eth/63 | — | — | Very old peer, no common version, disconnected |

## Decode Flow Verification

> **Note (2026):** ETH63–ETH67 decoders have since been removed. The live decode path covers ETH68, ETH69, and ETH70. The historical verification summary below reflects the state at the time this document was written.

All protocol decoders (ETH63-ETH68) were verified to be correctly implemented at the time of this update:

- **ETH63-ETH65**: Used legacy message format without RequestId (now removed)
- **ETH66-ETH68**: Use RequestId wrapper for request/response tracking (ETH66/67 now removed; ETH68 remains)
- **Message adaptation**: `PeersClient` automatically adapts messages based on negotiated protocol
- **RequestId detection**: `Capability.usesRequestId()` correctly identifies ETH68+ and SNAP1

## Impact

### Benefits
- ✅ Better compatibility with Geth and other Ethereum clients
- ✅ Proper negotiation with modern peers (eth/68, eth/69, snap/1)
- ✅ Enhanced debugging through comprehensive logging
- ✅ Clear documentation for operators

### No Breaking Changes
- ✅ All existing connections continue to work
- ✅ No changes to message encoding/decoding logic
- ✅ Backward compatible with older protocol versions

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with Geth nodes**: Verify negotiation selects ETH69 when both sides support it (ETH68 with eth/68-only peers)
2. **Test with older clients**: Verify peers advertising only eth/67 or below are cleanly disconnected (`IncompatibleP2pProtocolVersion`)
3. **Review logs**: Check that CAPABILITY_NEGOTIATION logs show expected behavior
4. **Monitor block sync**: Ensure different protocol versions all sync correctly

## Files Changed

1. `src/main/scala/com/chipprbots/ethereum/utils/Config.scala` - Updated supportedCapabilities
2. `src/main/scala/com/chipprbots/ethereum/network/handshaker/EtcHelloExchangeState.scala` - Enhanced logging
3. `docs/architecture/PROTOCOL_CAPABILITY_NEGOTIATION.md` - Architecture documentation
4. `docs/troubleshooting/PROTOCOL_VERSION_SELECTION.md` - Troubleshooting guide
5. `ops/gorgoroth/conf/node1/gorgoroth.conf` - Fixed duplicate content (unrelated cleanup)

## Related Issues

This addresses the core requirement:
> "align the protocol versions and understand why they eth 65 is being selected"

The implementation ensures:
- Protocol versions are aligned with Geth's approach
- Clear logging explains why any specific version is selected
- Decode flow for all protocols (ETH63-68) is verified and documented
