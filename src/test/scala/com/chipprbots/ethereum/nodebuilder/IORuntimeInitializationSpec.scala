/** Tests to validate that IORuntime is properly initialized in the NodeBuilder trait hierarchy to prevent null pointer
  * exceptions during actor creation.
  *
  * This test specifically validates the fix for the networking bug where IORuntime was null when PeerDiscoveryManager
  * tried to use it.
  *
  * The key issue was that `implicit val ioRuntime` was not lazy, causing initialization order problems when traits were
  * mixed together. Making it `implicit lazy val` ensures it's initialized only when first accessed, avoiding null
  * pointer exceptions.
