/** Hash-scheme RocksDB-batching wrapper around [[StackTrie]] for SNAP sync.
  *
  * The StackTrie itself is strictly write-only and emits finalised nodes via a callback. This wrapper owns the batching
  * policy:
  *
  *   - each emitted `(hash, RLP blob)` pair is appended to an in-memory buffer;
  *   - when the buffer crosses `batchSizeThreshold` total bytes, the entire buffer is handed to the `writeBatch`
  *     callback (a single batched RocksDB write) and cleared;
  *   - `commit()` finalises the right-boundary path and flushes the remainder.
  *
  * The `writeBatch` callback is the integration boundary. Callers pass in a function adapted from their storage layer —
  * typically `mptStorage.storeRawNodes` for the SNAP path, which goes through `FastSyncNodeStorage` and picks up the
  * pivot-block-number tag for pruning automatically.
  *
  * ==Why this is so simple==
  *
  * geth's equivalent (`pathTrie` / `hashTrie` in `eth/protocols/snap/gentrie.go`) carries non-trivial boundary logic —
  * left-boundary skip on resume, ancestor deletion, right-boundary discard. Almost all of that complexity is
  * path-scheme-specific: in path scheme, exactly one node exists at each trie path, so stale partial state from a prior
  * session must be cleaned up to avoid structural conflicts.
  *
  * Fukuii uses hash scheme — nodes are keyed by their keccak256 hash, so two nodes with different contents can never
  * collide. Re-emitting an already- written node is a no-op (RocksDB just overwrites the same key with the same value).
  * The boundary problem dissolves.
  *
  * If we later need to recover bytes wasted by re-emitting already-committed nodes on resume, a `skipLeftBoundary` mode
  * can be added — but it's a perf optimisation, not a correctness requirement.
  *
  * ==Concurrency==
  *
  * Not thread-safe. The expected usage is one wrapper instance per `AccountTask` (or per per-contract storage trie),
  * with all `update` and `commit` calls dispatched from a single actor or thread.
  *
  * @param writeBatch
  *   called with `(nodeHash, rlpBlob)` pairs when the batch threshold is reached or on `commit()`. The caller owns the
  *   actual disk write semantics (synchronous vs queued, fsync vs not, etc.).
  * @param batchSizeThreshold
  *   flush the batch when the accumulated blob bytes reach this size. 8 MiB matches geth's `batchSizeThreshold` in
  *   `eth/protocols/snap/sync.go`.
