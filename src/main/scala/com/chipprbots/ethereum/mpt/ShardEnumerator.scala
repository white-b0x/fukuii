/** Splits a state trie into disjoint, exhaustive shards so the post-SNAP recovery scan can walk it in parallel.
  *
  * A [[Shard]] is a subtree rooted at the node reached by consuming `pathPrefix` nibbles from the state root. The set
  * of shards partitions the trie's account leaves: every leaf belongs to exactly one shard, and the union of all shard
  * subtrees is the whole trie. Because account keys are `keccak256(address)` (uniform), the state root is a 16-way
  * BranchNode, so `depth = 1` yields up to 16 shards (one per populated first nibble) — the natural parallel unit.
  *
  * Correctness rests on two cases:
  *   - BranchNode: each populated child becomes its own shard (or recurses one level deeper). The children are disjoint
  *     by construction (distinct nibble) and exhaustive (every leaf descends through exactly one child).
  *   - ExtensionNode: all leaves under it share `sharedKey`, so it does NOT branch — we descend through it WITHOUT
  *     spending a shard level, extending the prefix by its nibbles. This is the subtle case (a short/degenerate trie
  *     whose root is an extension): mishandled, it would split or skip the shared subtree.
  *
  * A `pathPrefix` is the nibble path (one nibble per byte) consumed to reach the shard root; seeding a
  * [[com.chipprbots.ethereum.mpt.MptVisitors.PathTrackingLeafWalkVisitor]] with it reconstructs full account hashes
  * during the shard walk.
