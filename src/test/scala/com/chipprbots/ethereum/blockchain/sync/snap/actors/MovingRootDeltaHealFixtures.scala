/** Deterministic synthetic-trie fixtures for the spec 009 Moving-Root Delta Heal tests.
  *
  * Unlike [[HealingTrieFixtures]] — which stores nodes object-for-object for the rebuild-WALK tests — these fixtures
  * exercise the FETCH path: the heal seeds a frontier task, sends a `GetTrieNodes`, and `handleResponse` decodes the
  * served RAW RLP bytes and content-verifies them (`kec256(bytes) == requested task hash`) before storing. So every
  * served node here is returned as the exact `MptTraversals.encodeNode(node)` bytes whose `kec256` equals the hash the
  * coordinator requests — the same shape the production peer serves.
  *
  * No randomness: every node derives from a fixed [[kec256]] seed string, so the same `(rootHash, deltaBytes…)` come
  * out on every run and every host.
  *
  *   - [[deltaTrie]]: a small account trie whose ROOT is deliberately ABSENT locally (so the flag-ON
  *     seed-from-absent-root path fires) with a KNOWN missing-node delta: root extension → one absent leaf child. A
  *     peer serving the root + the child heals the entire 2-node delta and the frontier drains to empty.
  *   - [[incompleteSubtree]]: a present interior BranchNode whose child is ABSENT — the "download-present but
  *     subtree-incomplete" shape. Used by the completion-gate soundness test (C5): delta-discovery alone does NOT
  *     descend into a present interior node, so the absent grandchild would be missed without the pruned descent.
